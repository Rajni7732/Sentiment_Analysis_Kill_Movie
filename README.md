# Sentiment_Analysis_Kill_Movie

## Description

This project involves performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews to determine the overall sentiment expressed in the reviews. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to identify and categorize opinions expressed in text, particularly to gauge the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. This project focuses on analyzing movie reviews to understand the general sentiment towards movies based on the reviews they receive.

## Project Overview

The project leverages Python to analyze sentiment in movie reviews using two approaches:
1. **Simple Lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis**: A basic method using predefined lists of positive and negative words.
2. **VADER Sentiment Analysis**: A more advanced technique that uses the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon for sentiment analysis.

## How It Works

### 1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Data Collection**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file containing movie reviews.
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Text reviews are cleaned and prepared by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting text to lowercase.

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Simple Lexicon-based Analysis**:
     - A custom list of positive and negative words is defined.
     - Each review is tokenized, and the number of positive and negative words is counted.
     - Sentiment scores are calculated based on the difference between positive and negative word counts.

   - **VADER Sentiment Analysis**:
     - The VADER sentiment analyzer from the `nltk` library is used.
     - Each review is analyzed to obtain a compound sentiment score which indicates the overall sentiment.

### 3. **Analysis and Visualization**
   - Sentiment scores from both methods are computed for each review.
   - Overall sentiment scores and classifications are determined.
   - Results are saved and can be visualized using data analysis tools such as Tableau or Power BI.

## Getting Started

To replicate this analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git](https://github.com/Rajni7732/Sentiment_Analysis_Kill_Movie
   
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python installed.
Install the required Python libraries:
pip install pandas numpy nltk

Download the VADER Lexicon:
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

Run the Analysis:

Execute the Jupyter Notebook (sentiment_analysis.ipynb) to perform the sentiment analysis on the movie reviews.
Files
sentiment_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the Python code for sentiment analysis.
movie_reviews.csv: CSV file containing the movie reviews dataset.
README.md: This file.
Results
The project outputs sentiment scores for each review and overall sentiment classifications. These results can be further visualized using tools like Tableau or Power BI for deeper insights.
