review
"I had the pleasure of seeing Kill at its world premier during the Toronto International Film Festival, as part of a Midnight Madness screening. Kill represents an impressive change of pace for Indian cinema. Yes, action movies continue to be a mainstay of the genre, but rarely do Indian films feel welcome along their East and Southeast Asian compatriots. If I could best describe this film, think the sincerity and raw emotion of Indian cinema with the quality choreography of The Raid, Oldboy, or any Tony Jaa film.The Good:1. The simple storyline. I don't think I've seen an action movie with as pure and straightforward a storyline like this in a while. It's to the film's benefit, because it better highlights the action and makes the film essentially understandable to any audience member (As long as they aren't squeamish). There's also something about Indian cinema, where the stories don't need to be complex, but the emotions - as displayed - can be, and that more than picks up the slack.2. The performances. I'm surprised to highlight the performances for an action film, but yes, even the non-action performances are FANTASTIC in this movie. Laksh is great, but Raghav Juyal stole the show for me. He plays one of the most purely evil and detestable, yet impossibly likable villains I've seen in a long time, with INCREDIBLE comic timing and screen presence. In fact...3. The villains. You'd imagine that a movie about bandits on a train, seemingly motivated by nothing but money, would be one-dimensional red shirts. Kill does the exact opposite, giving these goons a real sense of humanity. I can't recall the last time I've seen villains GRIEVE their fallen brothers like they do in this movie. It almost makes you feel bad for them. There's also a great array of what I like to call sub-bosses (those villains who aren't quite the main guy, but have enough screen time and cool moments to be considered a step below), like the giant Siddhi and the conniving Uncle.4. The self-awareness. There are several moments in this film, towards the beginning, where I wasn't sure if it was deliberately lampooning Bollywood and its overuse of sentimentality and music. The audience was howling, so I'm going to assume yes, which is awesome. The idea of this movie starting like a typical ""boy-loves-girl-but-she-can't-love-him-back"" and transforming into this bloodbath was hilarious.5. The action. How could I have forgotten the best part? Kill gives us some truly claustrophobic, intense, gory, exhilarating action sequences. Not for the faint of heart.The Bad:I heard this sentiment amongst the audience too, but we all agreed...there is a certain point when it's clear the first act is over where...let's just say, the movie gets CONSIDERABLY better. (Also, *that moment* was accompanied by an absolute ROAR from the crowd)."
"Neither Bruce Lee-style quick action scenes nor violent horror flicks are particularly well-known in Indian cinema. Then arrives ""Kill"" and answers both of these questions. The gore is there and expertly done in an hour and forty-five minutes, even though it isn't as intense as in some of the Saw flicks.The fact that the movie wasn't entirely cheerful, in contrast to a conventional Bollywood romance, really caught me off guard. This is not a tale in which the good guys defeat the bad guys and come out on top.The commando part was expertly performed by Lakshya. Lakshya performed well in the part because of his well-defined figure, which the director highlighted at key points without giving away a full monty, and his passable acting abilities. Using a subtle blend of wickedness and malicious humour, Raghav played his part perfectly. Since I had never seen him appear on film for such a large amount of time, particularly as a villain, I was pleasantly surprised by his ability to carry off this character.If you appreciate some gore and crave adrenaline-fueled action, ""Kill"" is a must-watch. I am excited about the prospect of seeing more films of this kind from Bollywood soon!"
"The story is simple - good guys on a train, bad guys board the train, and what follows is two hours of non-stop smash you brains out gratuitous violence. The characters are enjoyable to watch and chemistry is pretty good. I liked the bad guy even though he reminded me of Pauly Shore.The story framework is quite simple but the story progresses in unexpected ways. It constantly adds to it so the story doesn't feel flat.Yes, it has some flaws but doesn't leave you too much time to question anything. Just buy your popcorn and go for it.I recommend this as great entertainment but you can't be squeamish."
"Kill is an absolute cinematic masterpiece that redefines the action genre. From the very first scene to the last, the film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go, taking you on a thrilling roller-coaster ride of non-stop adrenaline-pumping action and raw emotion.Dedication to mastering the tactical hand-to-hand combat is evident throughout, adding authenticity and depth to the character.The film's action choreography is mind-blowing, with brilliantly executed fight sequences that are gritty, realistic, and beautifully shot. The hand-to-hand combat sequences are fast-paced and brutal, elevating the movie to a whole new level of action excellence."
Did not expect this movie to be soo good considering it's coming from bollywood. They said it had some gore....... But boy oh boy one of the most goriest movies bollywood will ever make. The action was so damn good. When you think how brutal can a human be this guy turns it up even more. Lakshya deserves all the praise for all the action scenes and pure emotions he is able to show after some events in the movie. Raghav..... hats offf man that guy was on another level. I actually hated him soo much at one point in the movie but that goes to say what a fantastic role he has played. If you have a chance to watch it on the big screen DO NOT MISS THIS!!!!
"Wow, I am in disbelief that this is a Bollywood film! It is executed in a truly brilliant manner. The setup may be straightforward, but the action, direction, and acting are all outstanding. India's response to the Raid Films. I can't express in enough words how excited I am about what I witnessed. I was rooting for each kill and it remains engaging. The main actor has a promising career ahead in Bollywood and a flawless first film launch. Raghav is a pleasure to see and nails every scene he is in. The entire supporting cast performs admirably, but in the end, this movie belongs to the director. His vision and execution, without diminishing the lead's contributions, are truly remarkable. This movie is an absolute blast for any action enthusiast. No giveaways, just sharing joy like how the film made me happy."
"So the selling point for the movie was that this was going to be the most bloodiest goriest Indian film ever. As i started watching I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. Then i realized this film is a lot more violent than what I'm used to seeing in Bollywood films. Bollywood action films have plenty of action and fighting and the hero kills in large numbers, but this dude was doing it with his hands and the blood was pouring from everyone.Nothing that i never seen before just never from an Indian film. The uniqueness comes from the fact that the whole movie takes place on this train. Just a constant flow of battles happening in the tightest area possible
Some surprises really made this picture original to the genre and added to it being one of the best action movies done."
"I always think trains make for a great confined, slightly claustrophobic, setting for a thriller and with the help of the very easy on the eye Lakshya proving he's pretty nimble with just about everything from a fire extinguisher to a bathroom sink, we set about trying to thwart the intentions of a group of thirty-odd bandits who board a train heading to Delhi and proceed to brutally rob the passengers. That was pretty much the gist of their plan until they discover that the wealthy ""Baldeo"" (Harsh Chhaya) is travelling with his family. Never mind scraping around for a few old iPhones and some costume jewellery, their enthusiastic young leader ""Fani"" (Raghav Juyal) decides to take them hostage. Now this is probably his biggest mistake as it turns out that the man's daughter ""Tulika"" (Tanya Maniktala) is the love of the life of our intrepid commando ""Amrit"", and when events unfold becoming more violent, and tragic, this unleashes in him a feverish desire for retribution that proves the training at the National Commando School of India is extremely effective. With his colleague ""Viresh"" (Abhishek Chauhan) travelling with him, and with the help of one or two courageous passengers, the two soldiers are hopelessly outnumbered, but hugely inventive. This isn't a film you go to see for the dialogue - there isn't really very much, and what there is doesn't really matter. This is simply an end to end, action-packed festival of acrobatic carnage that isn't necessarily the most realistic - I think in real life, everyone would have been dead from the deadly kukri blows far earlier, but Nikhil Nagesh Bhat allows the film to build the tension to quite a crescendo. Sure, some of the combat scenes are a little too choreographed and repetitive, and I doubt it would ever encourage you to want to travel on Indian Railways, but this is every inch as good as it's Hollywood equivalents. Be warned - the violence is about as graphic as it gets, but I enjoyed it and wouldn't be surprised if Lakshya starts to appear in more films targeted more at the West."
"A pair of elite soldiers boards a train that is attacked by a ruthless gang. Combat is at close quarters. Deaths happen in gruesome and extreme ways, including by fire extinguisher. Armed forces, police, and gangs engage in combat against each other.Director Nikhil Nagesh Bhat experienced a train attack in real life and brings the experience to film audiences around the globe. While the film is shallow and women are treated poorly, there are unexpected twists and turn and it is enthralling for its action sequences. The world premiere in Toronto with the midnight madness crowd was a great deal of fun."
"Like the fast-moving train, the screenplay also paces itself swiftly without boring the audience. The entire film is about this one episode, and action blocks are lined up in most scenes, coupled with a few montage sequences to elevate the emotions. The action choreography is brilliant and cinematographer Rafey Mehmood executes them seamlessly, and the set pieces deserve special mention.Kill has the visual narrative of an action video game, with each level becoming more challenging, and promising an interesting episode. The linear screenplay also helps in keeping the audience hooked on the plot. The violence does escalate as the story progresses, staying true to its tagline of being the 'most violent' Indian film. In short, Kill is mostly an entertaining film for fans of the action genre."
"Kill may not be suitable for the faint-hearted but those who appreciate visceral and raw cinema will find the movie to be an unforgettable cinematic experience. One of the standout features of the film is its action choreography, masterfully executed by Se-Yeong Oh and Parvez Shaikh. The brilliantly executed action choreography and camera movement keep you hooked.The movie is gripping and its intense action sequences hold your attention from start to finish. Nikhil Nagesh Bhat has crafted a film that pushes the boundaries of the genre on Indian screens. From the beginning, the film grabs your attention with a fast-moving storyline. The sheer brutality and rawness of the action make ""Kill"" a unique viewing experience.Lakshya makes a confident debut, establishing himself as a convincing action hero. He delivers a standout performance, particularly excelling in the film's demanding action sequences. Raghav Juyal also impresses with solid performance. Tanya Maniktala shines with her screen presence. Known for her cuteness and good acting, she continues to impress. Abhishek Chauhan, Ashish Vidyarthi, and other supporting actors played their parts well.Direction 3.5/5
Acting 3.5/5
Action 4.5/5
Dialogues 2.5/5
Screenplay 2.5/5."
"This movie starts slow, has a decent storyline, an above average love angle, but when it comes to action, it is top class. It is not the typical hollywood style action, but old school fists, knifes, hammers, guns and whatever else can be found or used on a train to KILL. This movie takes its title so seriously that it literally lives up to the word KILL. I thought some of the scenes were fantastic and original. It is refreshing to see old school action in a modern setting with amazing visuals and background music. Worth watching at a movie theater with excellent sound. The gory and the emotional intertwining of love and action works for the movie. Go see the movie, not for the story, but purely for the action and you will not be disappointed."
"From the very beginning story doesn't waste time, and directly it's lead to main plot of the story where some bandits were trying to rob the train but unfortunately to brave commandos were exist in the same train and the Action Begin with a beautiful short love story, and main hero never let you disappoint, his acting and action just awesome and the villain was also hillirious and insane , the main plot of the movie is to show brutal action and film till the end prove that, No any unwanted song, totally worthy to watch please do watch surely you going to love if you guys love action movies . Thank you."
"Brutal, bloody and very violent but also in a Bollywood style with constant background music and overly dramatic romance scenes in slow-motion - I kept expecting them to break into song and dance up to a certain plot point. After that point however, it shifts up a gear and becomes shocking, gory and a little perverse at how much punishment is being dealt out on both sides. The setting was used to very good effect and although simple, the plot was good and had some good points to make. It could have been a bit shorter and more consistent in its pacing, but highly entertaining and a little surprising, if unrealistic. Although all subtitled, the language was a mix of English and Hindi with them alternating language mid-conversation, which seemed a bit odd."
"I typically refrain from posting moviereviews, but I am compelled to share my thoughts on this. This film is not merely a movie; it is a new benchmark in cinema. I have seen some of the greatest action and violence-based films, delving into Quentin Tarantino's blood-soaked narratives and Sam Peckinpah's ruthless action scenes. However, never before have I encountered anything like this. This is where madness converges with madness. I am at a loss for words to adequately describe what I have just witnessed. This film will undoubtedly set a new standard for bloodbath cinema worldwide, and I doubt if anyone will ever come close to replicating it.Sheer madness, absolute insanity, and continuous goosebumps throughout!Hat's off to Nikhil Nagesh Bhatt for making this MasterpiecePS: Don't watch it if you have a weak heart, either you'll leave in between or will be vomiting as the movie progresses."
"""One NSG commando trapped in a train with a gang of violent and merciless robbers"" - what a great premise for a no nonsense action flick! After listening to the rave reviews, I knew that I had to watch this. After all, I'm all for violent fast paced action movies but as much as I want this film to succeed so that more(and better) films are made in this genre, it's incredibly hard for me to recommend this film and it's not because of the level of violence portrayed. Half way through the fillm, an inevitable death scene occurs which completely derailed the film for me. No points for guessing the character who gets killed brutally in the scene I'm referring to, if you've watched the trailer. My point is: if you were going to kill that character anyway, why not be done with it in the first 10 minutes of the film? Or else pull a rabbit out of the hat and subvert the expectations of your audience by letting the character live. When the most satisfying 'KILL' in the movie isn't executed by the main character, but instead by two middle aged women, the filmmaker should have realized that something got lost in translation.Oh boy, I have got a lot more to spill. I'll tell you exactly how watching ""KILL' felt like: Imagine you're watching a guy playing a great video game but he really sucks at the game and as he progresses, you see him getting better towards the end and he manages to finish off the main boss but fails to finish even a single side objective. It's not the fault of the game, is it? I see a lot of people claiming that this is India's best attempt at gore filled action movies, not Animal. But putting the video game analogy back into play, Animal is like watching a kid have a sh** load of fun playing GTA V. Now you know why Animal made truckloads of money. Another comparison this movie was bound to draw, was with John Wick. This is the last problem with the overall execution of 'Kill'. The good guys die horrible deaths, the protagonist fails too often and barring one, all other bad guy deaths are mundane.This film suffered from similar issues that plagued Bhavesh Joshi. The balance between realism and entertainment is like walking on a tightrope. If you have absolutely zero f***s to give about the plot in an action flick such as this and you're only buying a ticket to see a few creatively executed, flawlessly choreographed action scenes then the second half of the film won't disappoint you TL;DR: if you're in just for the ""kills' then go ahead and watch the film."
"""Wow, what a thrill ride! 'Kill' is an adrenaline-fueled action movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The film's non-stop action sequences are expertly choreographed and performed with precision by the talented cast. The lead actor's performance is particularly impressive, bringing depth and charisma to their character.Lakshya & Raghav both did a wonderful job, yet again bollywood proved their competency in exploring this genre.Overall, 'Kill' is a must-see for fans of the action genre - it's a high-octane, action-packed masterpiece that will leave you breathless!"
"I don't remember the last time a film made me anticipate the next stunt/action sequence in 2024.I've watched my share of John Wick-type movies, so the intensity in 'Kill' wasn't new to me, but boy did I enjoy some of the things they did in this film. The action/stunt choreography deserves much praise and is the highlight - that 'ghost rider' sequence, LMAO, I hollered at that one. Editing, sound design and cinematography being well supportive.From an acting standpoint, the villain takes the cake. The hero and his buddy... were believable at best, but that's not a casting issue but a writing issue, I suppose. Didn't feel like this was Lakshya's first movie, so credit where it's due. The heroine...did well with whatever she was give.From a production standpoint, almost all of the film was likely shot on a very small set or inside a train. Almost all newcomers/ debutants, I bet they made a ton of money and spent very less in comparison. The makers of John Wick has apparently bought the rights to remake this in English.Fans of the action genre this one is for you. You'll have to grant some cinematic liberties, a few too many in my books. Had a hard time setting logic aside in several instances; the heroine's sister's missing and she looks at the hero and delivers romantic one-liners. Had me like, ""bruh your sister's missing. People are literally getting killed on the other side of the train. Show me some panic on your face....!""All that said, (very) enjoyable if you're an action buff!"
"Loved this movie. Zero typical Bollywood nonsense that's used in action movies. Producer, Director and the rest of the crew have done a smash job in making this movie compete with several Hollywood movies that have equally or even less violence and body count. Went to the theater with zero in-depth knowledge of the movie aside from trailers I have seen. Just know that for sensitive viewers that don't have a sense of humor and are afraid of blood: stay home. Most everyone else, this is a great flick to check out. Simply sit back, don't think too much and relax. Karan has done it again! Great work. Dark and funny movie."
"One of the worst movie ever seen, all characters and scenes are ok but killing of actres is worst scene...Dear script writer, what happened if you kill her father or mother but you kill main character... please don't write this type of script again. Increase main characters screen timing. Before I watch this movie, I was so excited to see but in the middle fase no one can expect that actres is no more. And whole movie is in train is not so good, different places give us more excitement.I cried while watching this movie because of just one scene and that was the killing of the actress. In the end movie is good but I give six stars only."
"The movie use only the people's physcology to engaged only on violence and worthless dramatic situations. From my opinion Director doesn't know the real meaning for Heroism. They only present hero having physical strength with zero mental strength. Hero is one who can use this mental strength instead of physical strength, and physical strength is last resort for him. Our youth's Brain are washed up with these type of movies, previously we had seen animal. How youth are inspired, they are inspired only to show violence, zero kindness. I feel sad for the upcoming society. Government Should proper steps for these type of movies. I really wasted my time for watching this movie."
"KILL deserves all the love and respect. Even if late, I hope people will show it the attention it deserves and make this movie a success. It is the best action movie of this generation for sure. Your eyes will be wide open the entire time, and you will feel the emotion of the protagonist and every punch he lands on the goons and antagonist. The plot is very simple but the execution is amazing. All the while I was thinking how will they drag this movie for the whole runtime but when you will watch it you will be in aww of the execution and the screenplay. I think Lakshya will go long way if he gets the right scripts. He has got all is required for a mainstream Hero."
"Fully saitisfy with movie.mass action,story could be more better but I enjoy this movie,other movie today I totally forget In this movie no comparison with any indian movie wether it was from bollywood,or any south movie or any Hollywood movie. In other movies we generally see their is lacking of revenge when hero is going to take revenge that was very easy in other movies. But In this movie proper revenge is taken with full satisfaction for viewers and also for the characters. No regret in any scene why this is happening perfect movie I saw. If I make story like this only I work to show some more story."
"You simply can't leave your seat for a moment; this adrenaline-pumping, heart-thumping, no-holds-barred movie keeps you at the edge all the time.The camera work and action scenes in this movie are not just well executed, they're brilliantly done, with no hint of melodrama to distract from the excitement.If you thought Animal was intense, get ready for another level of non-forgiving fight scenes. The characters' extreme strength and unwavering determination kept them in the battle, making it an unforgettable experience.The storyline was seamless; this is for you if you still want a no-nonsense entertainer."
"Think it's about time that Bollywood gave us a gory, unapologetic, wild , action thriller which resonates with Indian audience at the same time is not inferior to the Korean or Hollywood flicks of the same genre.The movies doesn't take a long time to establish characters which are so well sketched out and feal very real. It's claustrophobic in your face action makes your gut wrench (literally) considering almost the whole of it takes place in the aisle of a moving train.The extended family dacoit gangs feel realistic and so does the army commandos to counter. The leading man is a hero and a becomes a monster too in the 2nd half finding innovative ways to ""kill"" which is wildly satisfying and seems justifiable. You can argue about the casting of the lead but he gives a credible performance.The show stealers are the bad guys who actually make you feel unsafe sitting in the theatre and the director who gives a totally fresh Paisa vasool Raid style bloody(pun intended) action thriller with Desi emotions which works well."
"The movie revolves around a simple plot: Army commando Amrit fights to save his beloved Tulika from an arranged marriage, but a train hijacking by a gang of cold-blooded thieves led by Fani changes everything.Lakshya Lalwani's portrayal of Amrit was superb! He brought a perfect balance of courage and determination to the character,making every moment intense.Raghav Juyal's portrayal of Fani was absolutely gripping and powerful. Outstanding performance!Kill, a completely unexpected movie from Dharma Productions, marks a huge leap into the world of intense gore and brutality. It's a cinematic experience meant to be enjoyed on the big screen only!"
"Giving this an 7.5/10 ratingI'd give this an 8, but I feel that the violence and gore was not really needed for this, great action, yes, but it did not need to be this graphic. And to be clear, it's not the most violent film from India, I've seen plenty, just not as gory, and there are some though. That out the way, this is still a cracking good film.A train jacking goes horribly wrong is what this film is, then it's about families getting revenge and also just plain old love of beating the next person up. The love story is what saves the film and is what I could of had a bit more off, less killing, more love, the balance would of been better with a bit more on this story, but the real narrative is the robbery and the bandits.The location of a train is totally used so well, and does get grim all the time, and belief is grown out the window with what happens to the heroes, which spoils things.Nikhil Nagesh Bhat does a near perfect job as writer/ director, helped by writer Ayesha Seyd, but it needed to be less graphic and more character and story. The fighting is brilliant though."
"A Review of ""Kill""
An Under-marketed Gem""Kill"" explodes onto the scene as a thrilling action film that deserves far more recognition than it has received. While big-budget productions like ""Salaar"" and ""Saaho"" dominated the promotional landscape, ""Kill"" quietly delivers a refreshingly focused and brutal experience.Action with SubstanceThis film eschews the overused slow-motion sequences and melodramatic tropes that often plague action movies. Instead, ""Kill"" relies on expertly choreographed and tightly-edited fight scenes that feel raw and realistic. The action sequences are meticulously planned and executed with a practical approach, avoiding unnecessary CGI.A Story of Duality""Kill"" offers a surprising depth beyond its brutal action. The narrative explores the motivations of both the ruthless dacoits attempting the train robbery and the passengers caught in the crossfire. This creates a sense of empathy for both sides, a rarity in the action genre.A Hero Forged in FireLaksh Lalwani delivers a breakout performance as Lakshya, a skilled NSG commando thrust into a desperate fight for survival and revenge. Lalwani's dedication to both acting and performing his own stunts elevates the character, making him a contender for the title of a new action hero.Not Without FlawsWhile the action is undeniably impressive, there are occasional illogical moments within the plot. However, these weaknesses are overshadowed by the film's relentless pace and engaging narrative.The Verdict""Kill"" is a must-watch for fans of action cinema. It delivers a tightly woven story filled with tension, heart-pounding thrills, and expertly crafted action sequences. Despite a few narrative missteps, ""Kill"" is a powerful and under-appreciated film that deserves a wider audience."
"Well made first of the kind Indian action movie. Wish they had a 4dx version for it like how they gave for John wick. It would have been more fun by experiencing the train movements along with fight sequences on seat.We could probably state few 15-20 mins portions of fight sequence after interval was very much worth watching for the intense gore violence. They could have considered increasing it more though with much more better background music.But overall, it was quite an engaging first of its kind Indian action flick and hats off for the attempt.Except for the romance and sentiments in between, never a single boring scenes that was kept less engaging.The director should highly consider changing the music director for a better background score and include 4dx version, if planning for sequel."
"Kill movie I watched was one of the ghout its two-hour runtime, it relentlessly bombarded viewers with the same repetitive fight scenes, which left me with a pounding headache and a sense of discomfort. The entire movie seemed fixated on a prolonged train scene that offered little variety or intrigue, making it incredibly boring and devoid of any interest. Instead of engaging plot twists or character development, it merely recycled the same action sequences, failing to deliver any meaningful entertainment or excitement. Really disappointed to see other positve reviews , it seems some biased review. This much violence and no stroy line Reay disturbs audience."
"I watched ""Kill"" today, and it was a thrilling experience from start to finish. The movie's emphasis on brutality and hand-to-hand combat, with no guns in sight, brought a raw and visceral intensity to the action scenes that kept me on the edge of my seat.Lakshya delivered a solid performance, and it was great to see Ashish Vidyarthi in the mix, adding his veteran presence to the film. However, it was Raghav Juyal who truly stole the show. His performance was nothing short of spectacular-he absolutely killed it! His intensity and commitment to the role added a whole new level of excitement to the movie.Overall, ""Kill"" is a must-watch for anyone who loves gritty, no-holds-barred action and standout performances. Highly recommended!"
"Kill is a disgustingly violent and tightly contained thriller that's unrelenting in its bloodshed. It's going strong from the start with no filler whatsoever but after a shocking title drop 45 minutes in, it really hits its stride. It becomes a film that's completely unafraid to do seriously nasty things as the body count keeps rising and the emotional beats only get more tragic.Going into the film the title is the only thing that feels a bit naff, almost too blunt and possibly too broad. However, once it's dropped in the film it becomes clear very quickly that there's no better title for this. With a body count hovering around the high 40s and everyone's goal and motivation being directly linked to that title, it ends up being a perfect description.Lakshya Lalwani uses words less and his fists a lot more as it goes along, making him a thoroughly convincing action star fueled exclusively by rage. He has a level of confidence and physicality that implies he's a veteran of this genre so it's actually mind blowing to discover that this is not only his first foray into the world of action but also his first film.Raghav Juyal is a ruthless and unforgiving main villain who revels in his actions no matter how disturbing they get. All the other villains are really good too thanks to the interesting decision to make them all family in some way. It makes them feel a little less one note as every death has at least one of them in a devastated state and keeps the stakes high.Nikhil Nagesh Bhat's direction shines brightest whenever a fight is happening, which is almost always. The confined spaces are only used to its advantage and really enhanced by sound design that's crunching and squelching with every blow. Ketan Sodha's score rejects subtlety in favour of a diverse soundscape that can be everything from badass to moving with ease."
"Just one sentence about kill movie, never seen anything like this in Hollywood or Bollywood moviesYes there are Korean and Hollywood movies like raid redemption etc but this movie is beyond those. Only one off train scene after train starts, no songs no drama, all scenes with goosebumps and surprises. By 1st half I thought director might have utilised all best scenes but it continued in 2nd half.Kudos to all actors, action director and director. Intense throughout the movie, with all continuity, emotions with action, high quality acting, goosebumps guaranteed throughout movie.Will watch it again as it will be less intense and surprising."
"What have I just experienced? What was that all about? Was that really a 'Indian' action film? Without heroes flaunting their chiselled bodies, heroines looking glamorous, and without our protagonists fluttering to dance numbers?My mind is blown and I am at a loss for words; this is our answer to ""Raid - Redemption"", undeniably one of, if not the best our country has to offer in the action space.From its choreography of close quarter combats, to the cinematography in confined spaces, technically it's an achievement of its own, a genre defining execution that would be the benchmark to beat in the coming years.Now, don't get decieved by the first 40 minutes, many might be persuaded into thinking, ""what's all the fuss around the film, it's just your run of the mill action feature"", wait until the title card appears and you will bear witness to something extraordinary.I have seldom seen Indian movies, let alone Bollywood, tread such 'uncharted' territories. A treat for the gore fanatics and the action functions effectively because the storytelling is so emotionally impactful.Every broken bone, every torn limb, every single stab carries a reason, a purpose, it's not violent just for the sake of being violent, there's grief underneath. I loved how the writing starts with the intent of being a crime thriller then turned itself into a dark tale of retribution!One of the most satisfying 'tonal shifts' ever!P. S. Lakshya and Raghav, two standouts of the show, watch out for them!"
"Today, I went to the theater to watch the movie starring Lakshya, Tanya, and Raghav. The movie is purely action-based with brutality at its peak. I'm sure you haven't seen this kind of action movie in the Indian genre before-hats off to the makers. The story is simple, without many twists, turns, or suspense. The action choreography and camera movement are excellent and visually pleasing. The acting performances are also good, especially from the new actor Lakshya. I'm excited for his future projects. Raghav Juyal steals the show; he is an all-rounder in dancing, acting, and comedy. Tanya's character is the kind that brings peace to your heart, but she doesn't add much to the story apart from being the main lead's love interest. I also liked that the story is fast-paced, so you won't get bored while watching it.The negative aspects of the movie are that the main lead is too powerful compared to the local dacoits. It feels like Hulk vs. Normal humans. The action sequences, although well-choreographed, become repetitive at a certain point. The makers could have added some character arcs or emotional aspects to improve the storyline.Overall, I will give this movie 7/10. It's good to watch if you're an action genre lover."
"KillAn extreme thriller with hardcore violence and bloodshed.The plot of the story is of a NSG commando who has to face a dangerous dacoity gang in a moving train and how he take the odds and what he has to give up and will he saves the civilians inside the train forms the nutshell of the storyline.The action/fight sequences inside the moving train is simply brilliant and the action choreographer deserves a special appreciation.The later half of the movie takes a leap with extreme violence/bloodshed.Family especially children..please stay away.Good performances by Ashish Vidyarthi,Lakshya & Raghav Juyal. Fight sequences in the movie simply gives goosebumps.Great work by Nikhil Bhat who pulled of the story with goosebump moments throughout and Karan Johar for funding the project.A sure shot for the ones with the grit to experience an edge of the seat hardcore bloodshed/violence.Rating - 3.25/5."
"If you are fortunate to catch this movie on big screen, go for it.You won't regret it.Love Story can be told this way too..Rest is too compete required characters so ignore.The violent Indian action movie Kill has garnered an incredible Rotten Tomatoes score. The movie, which was written and directed by Nikhil Nagesh Bhat, is a Hindi-language outing that stars Lakshya as Amrit, an army commando whose attempt to prevent his girlfriend's arranged marriage is derailed when the train he is riding is besieged by a violent gang, against whom he must fight back and help defend the rest of the passengers. Positive Kill reviews first started pouring in after the movie's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2023."
"Basically, ""Raid Redemption"" on an Indian train and it delivers what it promised. The first half was solid but it is in the second half that the movie fully justifies its title and makes us realize all the action till then was just the buildup. A few choices in the narrative felt very brave as well as a bit confusing because some choices made me question how the film started and some other choices made me question how it ended. Maybe they were trying to add enough things to give a commercial appeal and then going full brutal even in defining the character, which made me a bit confused. The action in this was well choreographed as well as raw. Even when the kills get very emotionally satisfactory due to the buildups, the brutality of it is made apparent in a way that is not exactly heroic. And I believe that the villains are the ones who get more dialogue and the way it establishes all the relationships between them was very interesting. Other than thematic confusion, I also had confusion about who was where and why they weren't able to do some stuff at some points.Such modern dacoity on trains in North India is something that can actually happen in reality. And I have met people who act like the villain. It's really the hero who fights back that's more of a fictional element, which is very frightening and something that I couldn't get out of my head throughout the movie.I wish I had seen this with a houseful crowd who'd hoot and whistle for each hit and kills."
"""Kill"" is without a doubt the Indian counterpart to ""John Wick"" or, as some might say, ""The Raid"" on a train! Credit goes to director Nikhil Nagesh Bhat and Lakshya (Captain Amrit) for crafting an action flick that pushes boundaries not seen in Indian cinema for a long time. The film evokes the brutality, blood, and sheer intensity reminiscent of ""John Wick,"" while still offering a fresh contribution to the action genre. Appreciate ""Kill"" for what it is: pure, unadulterated action in an Indian cultural setting.Raghav Juyal as Fani stands out as the hidden gem of ""Kill."" His outstanding performance elevates the film. While his fame originated from his iconic slow-motion dance sequences, his dialogue delivery and witty humor amidst the gory violence and emotional turmoil showcase his versatility as a complete actor. As the saying goes, if the villain makes you crave revenge, he has done his job! The fact that Fani evokes such strong emotions is a testament to Raghav's remarkable acting skills, taking his talent to a whole new level.Director Nikhil Nagesh Bhat, known for ""Apurva,"" demonstrates his knack for character transformation and portraying the shift from 'hunted to hunter' in testing, unpredictable situations.That said, ""Kill"" doesn't quite merit a 10-star rating, falling short on three counts: story depth, limited action space, and character development.Story Depth: The audience is left in the dark about Amrit and Tulika's love story, receiving only fleeting glimpses of their past. Understanding Amrit's backstory would have added depth to his killing spree in the climax.Character Development: The bandits' background and their intricate connections remain unexplored. They appear as more than just ordinary criminals, suggesting a close-knit bandit family. A parallel storyline providing insight into these characters would have added layers to the narrative. Even in high-octane action, there should be a method to the madness, which was somewhat lacking.Confined Action Setting: While the action sequences on a train are intense, the claustrophobic setting limits the full immersive experience. However, Bhat compensates for this with innovative action choreography, cinematography, editing, catchy soundtrack and engaging dialogues.Despite these shortcomings, Lakshya delivers a commendable performance as Captain Amrit, embodying bravery, determination, and national pride. His portrayal ensures that Lakshya as Captain Amrit will be remembered, much like Keanu Reeves' John Wick.A new era in action filmmaking in Bollywood begins, and ""Kill"" could be just the first of many to come!"
"The story is very simple, good guys on a train, bad guys board the train, and what follows is two hours of non-stop smash your brains out with intense and gory violence. The characters are enjoyable to watch and chemistry is pretty good. Lakshya as hero's role, nailed it's character and performance.🔥 I also liked the villain's role played by Raghav Juyal. He was giving me the vibes of joker from the Dark knight as it was very unpredictable what will he do next and it made me fear of what bad will he do next.The story framework is quite simple but the story progresses in unexpected ways. It constantly adds to it... so the story doesn't feel flat and engages us in every moments and killings.I recommend this as great entertainment but people who don't like action movies...it is not recommended for you. And who loves action and violence.....Theatres awaits you."
"Kill, helmed by Nikhil Nagesh Bhat, is an epic action drama with a fast-paced screenplay and plenty of gore elements. It marks the first mainstream cinema attempt at this type of gore action film. The storyline is simple, but the action set pieces are well-choreographed and meet international standards. Lead actor Lakshya performs admirably alongside antagonist Raghav, who steals the show. Tanya Maniktala looks gorgeous and delivers an earnest performance. Veteran actor Ashish Vidyarthi makes a strong return, though his role is underwritten. Harsh Chhaya impresses in limited screen time. The protagonist's partner, played by Abhishek Chauhan, also engages in some intense kickass moments. If you're a devoted fan of the action genre, you shouldn't miss this film. Not only is it India's best action film, but it's also poised to secure a place among the best action films of all time."
"I have never seen such Indian movie and it kept me in my seat for the entire movie. The build ip was good and I could hardly find anu faults. Action and acting was baap level. All characters of the movie did justice.I would recommend all the ones with strong heart to watch this as it goes super super bloody. I hope this gets a good review and good response in theatres however if released on ott, it should also succeed.Such movies are for those who dare challenge Hollywood style action and entertainment for indian audiences. Only comment I would have is why the train did not stop between any station and un noticed for long period."
"This relentless assault on the senses delivers an unparalleled experience of unapologetic violence, adrenaline-pumping action, and grisly bloodshed that will leave even the most hardened genre fans breathless. It's a must-watch for action movie aficionados who crave intensity and aren't afraid to confront the darker side of human nature on screen.The director's unflinching approach to violence is evident in every frame, creating a visceral experience that's as shocking as it is captivating.The result is a tangible sense of danger and realism that permeates every scene. When blood flows - and it flows in torrents - it feels viscerally real, adding weight to the consequences of the on-screen violence."
"This is by far a great example of how a pure action movie is made . The interval block is a real deal . It's a pure no nonsense action movie , with a gripping story telling , content at peak , and interesting plot .Some sequence are really on a different level .This had raised the bar , that's how an action movie is made .Read somewhere that John Wick team has occupied this movie's rights for a remake .The performance by Raghav Juyal is really appreciable .Lakshya being a debut film he delivered a strong performance, the way he acted and performed the action sequences was remarkable .Good casting 👍🏻
9/10 Watch
Highly recommended!"
"First, they shown whole movie in the trailer. Which was nothing surprising, we have seen this countless times of someone taking revenge. Producer director selling this movie on USP of violence which is not seen before according to them. Well I guess they haven't seen enough movies yet, it was new once but not now when whole world release movies in Hindi language in our country. There is no story in this movie only useless revenge which you can easily watch in video games even. Fight sequence is so fake, lolz, no one could hurt hero, and no one have gun among bandits, this is glorified Mithun Chakraborty movie type. Not to mention star cast is phssssss, there was no scope of acting, if you want this violence to stop for few minutes to rest mind it would not, you have to sit thru or go out."
"The recent movie ""Kill"" has undoubtedly set a new benchmark in the realm of action cinema, driven primarily by the stellar performances of its lead actors and the enthralling narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. Among the standout performances, Raghav's portrayal of his character emerges as the highlight of the film, making it a must-watch for fans of intense drama and powerful acting.Raghav's performance in ""Kill"" is nothing short of mesmerizing. From the very first scene, he immerses himself into his character with such depth and intensity that it becomes impossible to look away. His portrayal is characterized by a perfect blend of raw emotion and calculated precision, making every dialogue he delivers feel both authentic and impactful. His crazy dialogues resonate with the audience, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll. Each line is delivered with such conviction that it not only adds to the character's persona but also enhances the overall narrative of the film.One of the most striking aspects of Raghav's performance is his ability to embody the character's complexities effortlessly. Whether it's a scene filled with rage, sorrow, or determination, Raghav navigates through the emotional spectrum with remarkable ease. His eyes convey a myriad of emotions, often telling a story far more profound than the words he speaks. This ability to express so much with just a glance or a subtle change in expression is a testament to his prowess as an actor. It is this depth and nuance in his performance that makes Raghav's character not just believable, but deeply relatable.Complementing Raghav's stellar performance is Lakshay, whose action sequences add an exhilarating dimension to the movie. Lakshay's action moves are nothing short of spectacular, blending agility, power, and grace in a way that is both thrilling and aesthetically pleasing. The choreography of these action scenes is top-notch, with each fight sequence meticulously crafted to keep viewers glued to the screen. Lakshay's dedication to his role is evident in every punch, kick, and maneuver, making the action in ""Kill"" a visual treat.The synergy between Raghav's emotive performance and Lakshay's dynamic action creates a balanced and engaging viewing experience. While Raghav draws viewers into the character's inner world, Lakshay provides the adrenaline rush that keeps the momentum of the film high. This balance ensures that ""Kill"" is not just another action movie, but a well-rounded cinematic experience that caters to a wide range of audience preferences.The direction and screenplay of ""Kill"" deserve special mention for creating a narrative that is both compelling and coherent. The storyline is gripping, with well-placed twists and turns that maintain suspense throughout. The character development is handled with care, allowing the audience to connect with the characters on a deeper level. This connection is further strengthened by the performances of Raghav and Lakshay, who breathe life into their roles with such authenticity.The cinematography and production design also play crucial roles in elevating the movie's appeal. The use of lighting, camera angles, and set design all contribute to creating an immersive atmosphere that enhances the storytelling. The action sequences are shot with precision, ensuring that each movement is captured in all its glory. The sound design and background score complement the visuals perfectly, adding another layer of intensity to the film.While ""Kill"" excels in many areas, it is not without its flaws. At times, the pacing of the movie may feel a bit uneven, with certain scenes dragging on longer than necessary. However, these minor issues are overshadowed by the overall quality of the film and the exceptional performances of the cast.In conclusion, ""Kill"" is a movie that successfully combines powerful performances, thrilling action, and a compelling narrative to deliver a memorable cinematic experience. Raghav's performance stands out as the heart and soul of the film, bringing his character to life with unparalleled intensity and emotion. Lakshay's action moves provide the perfect counterbalance, ensuring that the film remains engaging from start to finish.

The performances by the cast are commendable; their conviction adds depth to the narrative, making every moment feel real and engaging.The action choreography is top-notch, with seamless sequences that keep your heart racing. Each scene is meticulously crafted, showcasing both creativity and skill. Overall, ""Kill"" is a must-watch for action enthusiasts, offering a gripping experience that leaves a lasting impression. Totally loved it!"
"So the selling point for the movie was that this was going to be the most bloodiest goriest Indian film ever. As i started watching I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. Then i realized this film is a lot more violent than what I'm used to seeing in Bollywood films. Bollywood action films have plenty of action and fighting and the hero kills in large numbers, but this dude was doing it with his hands and the blood was pouring from everyone.Nothing that i never seen before just never from an Indian film. The uniqueness comes from the fact that the whole movie takes place on this train. Just a constant flow of battles happening in the tightest area possible Some surprises really made this picture original to the genre and added to it being one of the best action movies done."
"Right from the day I heard rave reviews in the international circuit to the mind-boggling trailer, I was sold on watching this movie on the big screen. Gladly, it was all worth the time and money.The story is about an NSG commando who takes matters into his own hands when he sees dacoits looting people on a running train. In turn, he becomes a saving messiah who unleashes his beast mode against the dacoits who are killing common people and his loved ones.Lakshya, in the lead, has slayed it and what a killer debut (pun intended). He has that screen presence and acting talent which will take him to great heights. Tanya Maniktala is decent in her small role and the same goes for Ashish Vidyarthi. Adrija Sinha has limited scope to perform, but she does justice to her part and I feel she is being underutilized by the industry. Raghav Juyal takes up the challenge of moving away from his comedic antics to a negative shade as he did in the Abhay series. Sadly, he doesn't have that menacing personality or acting prowess to land such a role. Kudos for his attempt though.If the story gives you deja vu of John Wick, you aren't alone. It has that feel, but in a good way. The screenplay is well-knit and sharp, jumping into the story right from the word go. The whole movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. Action sequences are filled with bloodbath and gory scenes of international level.The art department's construction of a train set is mere brilliance, making you feel like you are actually on a real train. There are no unnecessary songs or gimmicks, with the duration just an odd 90 minutes.Director Nikhil Nagesh Bhat has done his part and given the Indian audience something we all should be proud of. Rightly so, it is India's most violent movie ever, and people who love the genre shouldn't miss this action madness on the big screen.Dharma Productions is always blamed for producing unrealistic movies, but they backed this realistic yet adrenaline-pumping movie. Stop complaining about content if we can't support when something new is being served.#pranureviews #Kill #KillReview."
"Full of conviction. Perfect in every aspect, from the story to the action to the technique. Gripping and exemplary. I think this has raised the bar and future indian cinema will be different after this movie. Many people comparing this with Animal movie. Quality and purpose are totally different.Must watch for Hollywood cinema fans. If you liked Kill Bill and similar movie then this one for you.This probably is my first review ever but I feel there should be more movies like this which equally respect Audience and their intelligence.Totally engaging from first scene. Hopefully this movie meets the right Audeince."
"How often do you hear that some renowned director from Hollywood is planning to adapt a movie from Bollywood? Such is the case with Kill. This Nikhil Bhat directorial film, which redefines gore and action in Bollywood is about to have a remake coming from none other than the makers of John Wick. This is particularly notable as it features no established actors, yet has proven its mettle with impressive performances from budding talent, a compelling storyline, and an intense action quotient.With whole movie filmed inside a train, Kill is a perfect example of how an action movie needs to be. With no-nonsense scenes, without any unrealistic action sequences that makes you question science this epic will give you chills.Lakshya who plays commando Amrit Rathod is exceptional great who makes everything looks so simple by his superb action scenes. He's up against Fani (Raghav Juyal) who's leading a group of bandit's invading a running train. Juyal gives a comic but serious touch to all the mayhem that makes this a perfect watch.Hard to believe that this was made in Bollywood!!!"
"A bit of John Wick, a bit of Bullet Train oh and a bit Raid. When will the time come when Hollywood sues Bollywood for making money from copying every aspect of their movies.India has a country of over 1 billion people. It's very rare you get a quality movie or even tv series where you can easily say ""what a great story line or what an original concept of a movie"". Even Bollywood is copying Bollywood. These movies are a waste of time with only the rich making the movies and the poor who may well have the brains but unfortunately not the money to direct or write good quality movies. Bollywood B movies have the quality that shows the real talent."
"MASTERPIECE. MASTERPIECE. MASTERPIECE.Are you serious rn? Is this film from my country? THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ACTION FILM EVER MADE IN INDIA. I SWEAR. NO OTHER FILM COMES CLOSE.""Hum tumhare 4 ko maare aur tum saala humare 40 ko maar diye. Pure family ko khatam kar diye. Woh bhi akele""
Goosebumps. That's how you write an action film. Speechless. Brillaint acting. Amazing choreography. Brillaint Cast. Omg Raghav can act for sure. What a villain. Every single one of them were top notch. The dialogues, the BGM, the action sequences, the cinematography, the camera work, the sequencing of plot points. Pure perfection. I have never seen such brillaint writing from any Indian action film. The train to Delhi went too bloody. Every single character got their redemption arc. Even the side characters got a story. I don't understand how many people were there in Raghav's family as if it never ends. Our boi Amrit is no way lesser than John Wick. I think he can beat him too. Veere died doing third wheeling. That's why you should never indulge yourself with your friend's relationship. But nah, jokes apart, I don't even know what i am writing rn. This is not a review. Just my raw emotion. I am still screaming. You don't have to wait for the climax. The entire film feels like the climax. Not even a single dull moment. The entire film is shot inside the train and it is the most challenging task in filmmaking. One location. Whole story. Technically the film has no unnecessary song or over the top romantic moments. The love story is very powerful yet they kept it slay subtle. That's the beauty of writing. Wow. I don't even know what to say. 10/10, 100/100 take as many points as you can still it will be less. I salute the makers for taking such a huge risk amidst of mediocrity and making such a masterpiece. I hope audience will not let us down. Please go and watch and talk about this film. I expected nothing less but more hype than you all did for John Wick or any general Hollywood action film. PLEASE SUPPORT THIS FILM. DON'T LET IT DIE. THIS IS THE BEST ACTION FILM EVER MADE IN INDIA. Simply one word to describe the entire movie, ""pagal hai sab. Sab pagal hai"""
"Nice action movies.This is real action movies bollywood has so potential but doesn't make this type movie
This movie is so amazing action movies.Kill movies is awesome
All scenes in train action fight seen
Little bit Romance.Kill"" is an absolute cinematic masterpiece that redefines the action genre. From the 11th minute till the end, the film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go, taking you on a thrilling roller-coaster ride of non-stop adrenaline-pumping action and raw emotion.Directed by Nagesh (Indian Chad), is a pulse-pounding action film that delivers on its promises of intense, action packed combat and a compelling revenge narrative.The film's success lies in its expertly crafted fight sequences, with a stylish flair. While the plot may be straightforward, the relentless pace and precision in execution make it a standout in the genre. An action-packed ride that solidifies Lakshya as an iconic action hero and overall this is an adrenaline-fueled cinema."
"Direction, acting, cinematography...just amazing! Movie is gripping and gets you emotionally invested and provides a visceral experience. If you like John wick you will love this movie. Loving Indian cinema right with good movies like this being made.The villain is amazing too. Everyone did their parts very well. The editing was phenomenal as well. There is no time when you feel like your time is being wasted.There is no wasted corny jokes or songs used to waste time. I think Lakshya has a great entry into the movies and has great potential. Tanya maniktala is adorable and can't stop looking at her beautiful eyes."
"Once in a while there comes a movie which creates a benchmark, a significant leap from mediocrity or 'cringe' which is a socially accepted standard/requirement in Bollywood and for the audience nowadays. Nikhil Bhat, has literally obliterated the convention of how action movies are made in Bollywood. Rather than glamorizing the so-called 'RAW-agents' flying helicopters inside a warehouse or dancing in bikini in a beach in Europe, he has pitted highly trained NSG commando against a group of low-life thugs.The action sequences are like music but for the eyes. Brilliantly choreographed without the 10 sec slow-motion sequences every 30 seconds every time the 'hero' enters a scene or lands a punch which audience here is used to. Fast, to the point, no-nonsense.Bravo ! We finally have an action movie where ACTION takes precedence over the actors 'Bollywood STARS' performing it.Hats-off the to the casting director, Lakshya, Tanya and Abhishek did their part just right. But the main antagonist Raghav just takes the cake in this respect, gets 'under your skin' so easily. Emotions are so rightfully portrayed, the driving force of the action.Note: Rumors are a Hollywood remake is on the cards."
"What begins as a romantic rescue soon morphs into a slapstick slaughterfest when bandits on a train decide to turn the carriage into their own personal WWE ring, and our Romeo starts cracking heads like piñatas at a deranged birthday party.Our hero, Amrit (Lakshya), is a military commando with the emotional range of a brick and the muscles of a bodybuilder who's never skipped leg day. He's tailed his childhood sweetheart Tulika (Tanya Maniktala) onto an express train to New Delhi, hoping to rescue her from the horrors of an arranged marriage. But their tearful reunion is rudely interrupted by a gang of bandits armed with an eclectic assortment of knives and hammers, presumably raided from the world's most violent Home Depot.Will Amrit and his trusty military buddy (Abhishek Chauhan) manage to thwart these goons? Can the lead villain, played by a seductively menacing Raghav Juyal, outshine our baby-faced hero? And just how many kitchen utensils can be artistically embedded into someone's skull?To answer these burning questions, writer and director Nikhil Nagesh Bhat shifts into fifth gear and never downshifts.Cinematographer Rafey Mahmood, along with action specialists Parvez Shaikh and Se-yeong Oh, orchestrates martial arts sequences of such balletic brutality, you half expect a jazz-hands finale. As the actors huff and puff through their exhausting dance of destruction, spare a thought for the Foley artists, whose squishy, crunchy, and splattery sound effects must have been a nightmare to produce-imagine a sound library built entirely from stepping on cereal.Rated R, ""Kill"" is an unrelenting assault on the senses. It's the kind of film that takes ""blood, sweat, and tears"" literally, ensuring you leave the theater both laughing and questioning your own sanity.By Manav Kaushik."
"This is cinematic brilliance at its best. What actors are able to do in a constrained setting crushes any other movie with a larger than life budget made in the history of Indian Cinema. Crisp editing, unparalleled action choreography and mind blowing acting with a no nonsense storyline. Debutant Lakshya makes an indelible impact and truly kills it and tells the world that he is here to stay for the long haul. Raghav in a menacing character surprises the audiences. Tanya carries the emotions in her eyes and is a delight. This film is a landmark in global filmmaking and deserves all the love, box office collections and critical acclaim. Go watch now!!"
"Kill is one of my favourite action/combat movies. I got vibes of Ong-Bak meets The Raid. It's brutal and it's set on a train which makes it even more enjoyable. Just when I thought Dev Patel's Monkey Man might be one the most brutal action film of the year, Kill raised the bar to a whole new Level.Kill kicks off with a typical Bollywood romance plot featuring a love triangle and an upcoming arranged marriage. Those who haven't watched a Bollywood movie before might feel they are watching the wrong film whilst the veterans will be hoping that the action starts before too long.The protagonist, played by Lakshya, is an army officer who finds himself on a train when a robbery is taking place. At this point the movie is pretty reserved and if you're like me you'll find yourself scratching your head, asking a specific question which is somewhat addressed by the characters on screen. However, there is a catalyst during the opening act which transforms this film in the blink of an eye and it becomes ones of the most insane films I've ever watched. Amazing fight scenes, high stakes and brutal action! It's a must watch if you like Action films.What's cool is that it doesn't forget it roots. It's emotionally driven. Despite the focus on pure action, you see all individuals deal with the likes of hierarchy, family and respect which adds flavours to the characters. Even the comic relief works well. Raghav Juyal put in a great performance as one of the many villains.Kill is definitely one of the best pure action/combat films I've seen. A must watch for any action fan."
"This is not just another action flick. This is an attempt to make a world class cinema. And right there it is. It's a bull's eye , it's insane, it's a crafty narrative. Well thought out and executed with conviction. The cast , the producers and the crew left nothing behind to create this masterpiece. Every character makes you feel anxious. The space, speed, the feel, the tempo and everything else are just incredible. Once in a while you actually come across something that makes your mind explode and your body is just there to support your heart. Film making at its best. No more words just run and watch it !!"
"""Kill"" is a spectacular addition to the action genre, proving that a well-crafted film doesn't need the crutch of Bollywood's conventional action stars. Instead of relying on the typical faces, director Nikhil Nagesh Bhat and the production team, including Karan Johar and Guneet Monga, have opted for fresh talent, which elevates the movie to new heights.Lakshya, in the role of Amrit, delivers a powerhouse performance. His portrayal of a national security guard commando is both intense and believable. Lakshya's physicality and dedication to the role bring a raw and gritty edge to the character, setting a new benchmark for action heroes in Bollywood. His ability to convey emotion amidst the chaos of relentless action scenes is commendable and keeps the audience thoroughly engaged.The decision to cast Raghav Juyal as Fani, the brash young kidnapper, is another masterstroke. Juyal, known for his dancing skills and comic timing, surprises with his versatility. His performance is layered, bringing a unique charm to a character that could have easily been one-dimensional. The dynamic between Juyal and Lakshya adds depth to the narrative, making their confrontations more thrilling.The film's plot, centered around a high-stakes battle on a train to New Delhi, is gripping from start to finish. The confined setting of the train amplifies the tension, making every fight scene more impactful. The choreography by Sheikh is exceptional, showcasing brutal, fast-paced combat that is a feast for action aficionados. Unlike the more stylized and often unrealistic fight sequences seen in many Bollywood movies, ""Kill"" offers a refreshing dose of realism and raw energy.Nikhil Nagesh Bhat's direction is a testament to his vision and understanding of the action genre. He skillfully balances the film's intense action with moments of character development, ensuring that the audience remains invested in the story. The screenplay, co-written by Bhat and Ayesha Syed, is tight and efficient, never allowing the pace to slacken. The dialogues are sharp and often laced with dark humor, adding another layer of enjoyment to the viewing experience.One of the most striking aspects of ""Kill"" is its ability to maintain a high level of suspense and excitement throughout its runtime. The film's sound design and minimalistic use of music enhance the atmosphere, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. The visceral impact of the action sequences is heightened by the film's excellent editing, which ensures that every punch, kick, and gunshot feels real and immediate."
"This movie deserve 10/10, honestly saying this, i have never given any rating to any movie but this one. I registered my id on imdb just to give rating to this one. Best action/violent movie of india. A masterpiece which starts with a little love story but ends up in a sea of action. It is keeping up to the line - "" most violent movie of india "". Raghav juyal's comic timings plus his action and role is proving the fact that he is really a worthy actor. Even the hero i have never seen this guy but he did realllllyy good. But for the heroine i wanted more emotional connection to be built but it was not there. Still she did her best."

"Boring movie.Visually stunning, but overrated' Easily one the most overrated movies of all time. I think people are over-analyzing this one. The story is actually so thin, that there's almost no story at all. And it didn't help that the main character was poorly acted. Way too long, way too boring, it's called an Epic Crime movie..epic disappointment..in my opinion. Actually it's is an EPIC DISAPPOINTMENT... Just doesn't meet the mammoth expectations... Director had a dream cast and a massive budget on hand, but creates a HUGE MESS. I am a big fan of Director . But this much awaited movie was not up to my expectations. I was disappointed. Lakshya is a very good actor but needs improvement . First half was better but the second half was total scrap."
"Kill killed that! The mode switch during title reveal, OMG . One of the epic movies. Not sure why we are not supporting movies which are good. The action was top notch. Intense moments! This the Indian answer to John wick, Raid etc one of the epic movies ever made! The whole movie happens in a train. And no moment is wasted. Straight and out action. Villain is under rated and Lakshya who plays the protagonist gives the chills and shows what a man can do when he loses everything he holds dear. No mercy pure action kind of movie
If you liked movies like extraction John wick and raid this movie is for you. Pure Raw and gore! I don't usually review but this movie man was pure goosebumps."
"Dude, just completed the movie and what was it 😭 I'm just all into the movie!!! Superbly created!! Indian cinema really needed this. John wick? Naah bro, this commando is just crazy on another level, and nothing seems fake or masala, it is all so well done. Especially the emotions shown with the villain side, you feel for every death, whether it's the public or the villains. Was a crazy ride filled with blood and literally the gorriest movie!!😭 But seeing the box office collections, I'm really disheartened and surprised, because this movie really deserved a really good collection and it is surely going to be an ideal movie gor the future movie makers in the bloody action genre."
"Advertised as the most violent Indian action movie ever made, Kill is Die Hard on a train, with army commando Amrit Rathod (Lakshya) boarding a locomotive to New Delhi to save his girlfriend Tulika (Tanya Maniktala) from an arranged marriage, but instead finding himself using all of his military fighting skills against the gang of knife-wielding bandits who take over the train to rob the passengers.Director Nikhil Nagesh Bhat steadily accelerates the pace, the action hitting high speed just before the half-way mark (which is when the title eventually appears), Amrit activating beast mode when ruthless bandit Fani (Raghav Juyal) unwisely attacks Tulika. The action is certainly extremely brutal, people dying in all manner of horrible ways, ensuring that the film lives up to the hype. The close-quarters fight choreography in the confined location is impressive and the film doesn't hold back on the blood and guts.While not quite as well-executed as The Raid and its incredible sequel, to which it has been compared, Kill is still a hugely entertaining movie: just under two hours of non-stop, adrenaline-fuelled, blood-drenched mayhem.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."
"There is a reason why KILL was being termed the most violent film of India. There is a reason!!KILL was released last year but not in India. That time, whoever watched it at TIFF, classified this as a next gen action thing from India . They weren't wrong really. If Vanga said Animal would be the most violent film in India , then clearly they didnt know a film named KILL existed already.In terms of plotline, KILL is like an EXTRACTION, simple plot with no twists !! The main motive of KILL is to showcase its action. Now this can again be a concerning point for many who expect to see story along with action. If you are one of them, drop those expectations or skip the film. An NSG commando (played by lakshya) travelling on train with his lover encounter atleast 40 train robbers . Things get out of hand when Lakshya decides to resist and kills one of the gang members. What brings the monster out of Lakshya and how he kills each one of them is the plot of the film.What sets apart KILL from the other action films in India is the quality, brutality and location of the action sequences. The whole action set piece is inside a moving train with very little space to manouvre (apologies for the wrong spelling). This means the action can be viewed from very close upfront.Next , the brutality. There is a reason why this is an A rated film and even the strong hearted can be forced to close their eyes seeing the brutality of the killings in the second half. You can hear the bones crack, flesh tear, teeth break all make the killings sound so realistic yet horrifying. There are almost 40 different ways in which the killings are done and each one, if you are an action lover will bring the whistles out of your mouth. In my theatre, many girls were screaming with terror seeing the gruesome killings. I havent seen this before ever. There is a reason why Raghav , the villian says 'Aise kaun maarta hai bey!!"". 1hr 45 mins whizz past in just 30 mins.Another brilliant aspect of this film is the portrayal of human emotions. Even the goons in the film are after all humans and the film doesnt show them as people with no fear and emotions. Instead, the goons , on seeing their dead allies, desperately want to get off the train fearing their lives, after all they were just train robbers, not some Mirzapur dons. Some of them even say they have families back at home. They cry and mourn with grief when they see their loved ones dead. As i mentioned even Raghav the lead goon , starts shivering seeing the brutality all around him.No songs, no emotional drama in the train , pure human emotions of losing closed ones. The story never deviates from its line. And if you were wondering how noone informed police through cellphone about the goons, KILL has an answer to that as well.Performance wise Lakshya and Raghav steal the show although lashya still has to work on his facial expressions a bit. Raghav looks to be enjoying . Tanya , laksya's lover does a fine job in her small but important role.Negatives - the simple plot !! As i said earlier many dont like to see just an action fest (like it was in Extraction) so KILL might just get flak from these audience. Also not to forget, the film does get repitetiveNikhil Nagesh Bhat could well be the next thing in action genre. He was pretty brutal with APURVA and now with KILL he has upped his game. He is a serious contester to Vanga in terms of showing violence or you could say Bhat is the North's answer to Vanga from south. But he needs to now blend these action films with better plotline .Overall, a must watch for action lovers."

"""Kill"" isn't just a movie, it's an experience. It's a visceral, brutal journey into the heart of darkness, where violence is as much a dance as a weapon. This isn't just a story of revenge; it's a meditation on the cycle of violence, the toll it takes on both the perpetrator and the victim.The film's greatest strength lies in its unflinching portrayal of brutality, yet it avoids gratuitous violence, instead using it as a powerful tool to drive the narrative forward. Every punch, every scream, every drop of blood serves a purpose, contributing to the film's stark and haunting atmosphere.But ""Kill"" is more than just a violent spectacle. It's a story of redemption, a journey of self-discovery that takes the protagonist on a path of destruction before leading him to a fragile glimmer of hope. This duality, the raw power of violence juxtaposed with the yearning for redemption, creates a powerful emotional resonance that lingers long after the credits roll.The performances are electrifying, with the lead actor Lakshya delivering a tour-de-force portrayal of a man consumed by vengeance. The supporting cast is equally impressive, bringing depth and complexity to their roles.Special mention to Raghav Juyal very underrated VILLIAN. Also Lakshay has to go a long way after this movie 🍿 best wishes for him.""Kill"" is not for the faint of heart. It's a film that will stay with you long after you've seen it, leaving you questioning the nature of justice, the cost of revenge, and the possibility of redemption.This is a film that demands to be seen, a cinematic masterpiece that will redefine your expectations of Indian cinema."
One of best action film in the history of indian cinema. The acting done by lakshya is on point the perfect combination of emotion and rage and acting by raghav is something which is unexpected he has done the best he can do as a villain and the supporting caste is also on point the VFX and the graphics are insane the film has pure brutality when it comes to action if someone is planning to watch don't think to much you should watch this film as soon as possible because movies like this are not rewarded by the audience as much they deserve because there is no big name in this movie so please watch .
Loved this movie such an Adrenaline rush this movie have never expected this level of action film for Bollywood just takes 10 minutes to build and then get ready for an action filled train ride raghav killed it in acting one thing I specifically love about this film is that it gave equally importance to every character that was involved and the bandits have a human side too not like typical movie in which just they fight for no reason there was a motive and every bandits were involved the gory level the brutality loved it to conclude this movie is amazing go if you are an action fan you won't be disappointed.
I really don't believe its on Bollywood movies very clear without any cuts and stupid songs action is absolutely outstanding. I don't review movies but this movie is different i think if we don't pramote tham acting of each actor is outstanding my favourite is raghav i really don't believe this the man that is see doing what a performance buddy and lakshay is really outstanding i never see such a intensive close combat before in any indian movie heads of to this person for doing this they set such a high bench mark for action that i think not soon any actor can over take last i want to say if you love action and true blood pls go and watch this movie.
"A train heist gone wrong -- a thrilling, action-packed film that delivers an intense and gripping experience, non-stop! After 10 minutes of establishing the context of characters, the film grabs your attention and doesn't let go! Some of the action will make you defensively curl in your seat!The distributors have done near zero marketing, so folks are hardly aware of this film. But, its far superior to the typical, nonsensical Bollywood action where the hero is invincible with excessive slow-mo BS action shots, and thoughtless melodrama.This movie has substance, style and realiasm. Brilliant cinematography and fight execution within the confined spaces of Indian train compartments, keeps the action realisticWhile the film, with minimal dialogue, creates a narrative that is beliveable and emotinally connects you to the plights of train bandits and passengers... the hard-hitting, brutal action sequences amplify the tension and excitement of the rapidly unfolding events..Besides Dev Patel's Money Man, this film has the most refreshing autheticity - focused on real human emotions and high-stake situations. Much better than Animal - Scarface cloneThis movie deserves far more recognition than it has received. Highly recommended."
"I don't know how this film compares to other Indian productions, and I don't intend to speak about it limiting myself to the language spoken in the film.The plot is simple and seems interesting at first glance - but that's about where it all ends. The action scenes are designed to be shocking, but they are far from it - they are mostly comical. The endless use of cold weapons is monotonous and incomprehensible - the bandits collectively have one faulty gun.The injuries and the amount of damage the protagonist endures are comparable to the ""damage"" taken in an FPS video game on easy mode where medical packs are found at every corner.Overall: The action is nonstop but tiresome. The explicit scenes are poorly conceived and comical. The ending surprised me and I liked it (the last few shots).Whoever compared this film to the movie RAID should be shot!"
"I haven't seen this kind of raw action movie in ages. It shows how a commando, when on his own, can fight with unmatched skill and determination. The film is incredibly engaging, with no interrupted songs to distract from the intense storyline - a pure masterclass in action cinema. Take a bow, everyone, especially Lakshya, who plays the NSG commando, and Raghav Juyal, who plays the villain. Their acting is phenomenal and adds depth to this exhilarating movie. The direction and cinematography are top-notch, creating a visually stunning experience. The realistic fight scenes and gripping plot make this film stand out. If you're a fan of non-stop action and compelling performances, this film is an absolute must-watch."
"What a terrific cut throat movie ! Nailing and gripping !.....
Epitome of violence and classic bloody action sequences.Exhilarating action-packed thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The fight choreography is absolute top-notch !And you are stuck nailed to the seat ! .........I guess, its new age Indian cinema coming up with this. So much of gore and carnage and butchery....but u dont get sick . But in fact u get dragged into it .No spoilers.. but one scene will really raise ur hair stand :)Hidden gem of Indian cinema.. so dont keep it hidden. Go Must watch.........."
"The story of the movie is quite simple and to the point, Which revolves around how a commando trying to save his love during a train journey.Action is the main hero of the movie because the way the makers have represented action in this movie is coming under never seen ever category. The techniques to kill any person, the action choreography, the deadliest fight sequences inside a train, the brutality, the blood scenes are totally insane.The debutant Lakshya has given a remembering performance with his high octane action sequences. Raghav Juyal has also performed well in negative role.Tanya Maniktala has given her as always sweet and cute performance with a little bit action scenes.Overall everyone should watch this movie to see what's really action called."
"The on-camera actors look good when they work each other over, and the filmmakers do a fine job of not only keeping pace with their performers but also cutting their fights in such a way that you never have to strain your neck to see whatever's just out of frame. The sound design also keeps a certain ambient tension up, and the spare use of music on the soundtrack keeps you wondering about what might be coming up next. Better yet, the blood and gore that erupts from a range of good and bad characters is also effectively surprising, at least on a moment-to-moment basis. Kill"" tics off most of the essential boxes for a good popcorn flick, making it easy to resist but harder to pass up."
"In short ""This is an awesome action movie"". ""Kill"" is a non-stop action extravaganza that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Set predominantly on a train, the movie delivers a relentless series of intense, realistic action sequences. Raghav's portrayal of the villain is superb, bringing a chilling authenticity to the role. The film doesn't shy away from gore, adding to the raw and gritty feel. If you're a fan of high-octane action and powerful performances, ""Kill"" is a must-watch..In conclusion, ""Kill"" masterfully blends superb acting and high-intensity combat, making it a standout in the action genre. Be prepared for a gripping and unforgettable cinematic experience."
"This movie has opened the path for new breed of action movies! Perhaps one of the best actions movies in Indian cinema! The director has done a really good job in keeping the screenplay from beginning to end, to the point. There is no moment in the movie, where I felt bored. No unnecessary scenes. Love story is also to the point. Action scenes in the first half are good but after interval, the real action begins!I am a martial artist and I love action movies, provided they are done in a realistic way. I don't like mass commercial action movies. I like the raw and real ones. And this movie does complete justice to it. My action taste buds are thoroughly satisfied :DLakshya has done a fantastic job!! It felt good to see a fresh face rather than the old Bollywood actors who still don't wanna give up as heroes in movies! The only place where I felt Lakshya could have done better in expressing his emotions was, when a loved one died.Raghav completely surprised me with his outstanding performance as the main villain in the movie. Hats off to him!Animal movie had gore violence sometimes without reason. But Kill has a very strong justification for the gore violence. It showed how brutally an NSG commando can eliminate someone, if pushed beyond the limit!Although the movie was very realistic, towards the end I felt a bit disappointed about cinema freedom on how Lakshya survived some really bad attacks.Thanks to the director and producers for making a film in Bollywood which is away from the mass commercial action crap.Go watch! Not for the faint hearted. :D."
"After returning from a mission, Captain Amrit Rathod discovers the love of his life is set to be engaged to another. He immediately sets out to find her and make things right. After surprising her on her train back to Delhi and proposing to her, they both dream of the endless possibilities of their future. Their time on cloud nine is cut short when bandits lockdown their train compartments and start looting and hurting passengers. When tragedy strikes, Captain Rathod does what he does best, kill.This Hollywood-Bollywood collaborative production is straightforward, intense, and exhilarating to watch. The story is simple and only takes a little to keep up with. It has the romantic undertone of a classic Bollywood romance, with a Hollywood action flick's intense violence and gore. The action choreography is excellent without it being over the top or far-fetched. The movie gets right to it and takes its foot off the accelerator at the end. No song or dance sequences or parts that drag on. Catch this in theaters if you are looking for a high-octane action movie and a foreign film."
"When the title card for Kill finally appears on screen you know things are about to go down. Before that we're treated with a simple-melodramatic intro that sets the minimal plot up and moves every character where they need to be. Decent, albeit minimal fights ensue on the train and I was left wondering when the ""kill"" part of the movie promised in the trailers was going to happen.Well, Kill does something I legitimately did not expect and boom the title card appears. The next hour is revenge served up with a solid dose of bloody violence. For the next hour the fight choreography is amped up and every bad guy is dispatched with brutal aplomb. Kill does revenge well and it's entertaining watching our commando dispatch justice. Does Kill compete with my golden standards of The Raid 1 and 2? In my opinion it does not, but it is entertaining throughout and I enjoyed about every minute of the runtime.If I were to nitpick something that took me out of the experience from time to time was the terrible ADR. Most of the voices sound directly from a sound booth, not like they're on a moving train. Even during the fight scenes when people are screaming in pain the ADR is painfully obvious and poorly done. It's a technical gripe, but it's noticeable none the less.Never the less Kill delivers the goods where it counts. The fight choreography is crisp, bloody, brutal and easy to follow. It's no surprise that an American remake of Kill was announced shortly before the movies stateside release. The revenge is oh so sweet in Kill, and I can easily recommend this to any fan of action cinema."
"I finally watched Kill, and it's a brutally gory and violent film that lives up to its promise. The first half establishes a gripping tone, while the second half explodes into relentless carnage, creating intense terror. The action scenes, set in the confined space of a train, are jaw-dropping, featuring an unyielding killing spree with a raw and unflinching display of blood and gore that hits like an adrenaline shot, leaving you craving more .Kill is going to be a film that hasn't been seen in Bollywood yet! A definite success with its unique content and graphic visuals! 👏🏻 The star of the film is also a newcomer Lakshya."
"Out of words.The theatre was cold, but the movie made you shiver. I was still shivering when I came out. Never has anything like this been made in hindi. It is in a way a coming-of-age for Indian cinema.I was waiting the movie to end so that the violence ends, but at the same time, wished that the protagonist gives it back.The Indian trains that we love so much, will never be the same again, for me. The bedsheets, the floor, the commode, wash basin, doors will all be looked differently, next time I board themThus, the movie clearly is able to reach the audience's psyche. Is the audience capable to handle it?"
"""kill"" delivers a rollercoaster of action and emotion, anchored by Raghav's breakout performance, showcasing previously untapped potential. His portrayal is award-worthy, elevating the film to new heights. The direction is flawless, weaving together intense sequences with emotional depth. A must-see for action aficionados and anyone craving a gripping cinematic experience. The pacing is tight yet allows for moments of quiet intensity, building suspense and emotional resonance throughout. The seamless integration of action and storytelling is a testament to the director's vision and skill. The decision by the John Wick franchise team to consider a remake underscores the film's universal appeal and potential to captivate audiences worldwide."
"Kill (2023): A Brutal Brawl on Rails
""Kill"" is a high-octane action film that throws you right into the chaos.The main draw here is the action. The film delivers a relentless barrage of hand-to-hand combat and brutal violence. The choreography is tight, with a focus on brutal efficiency rather than flashy displays. The confined space of the train adds a layer of tension to the fights, making every blow feel impactful. Be warned, this is not for the squeamish, the fight scenes are bloody and unforgiving.Simple Story, Strong Performances
The plot itself is fairly straightforward - good guys versus bad guys on a train. But the simple premise allows the focus to remain on the action and the characters. Both Lakshya and Amrit are well-developed enough to be invested in, with the film hinting at their troubled pasts. The performances are strong, especially from the lead actors who convincingly portray the grit and determination of their characters.Overall
If you're looking for a pure adrenaline rush, ""Kill"" delivers. The relentless action sequences are masterfully choreographed, and the strong performances keep you engaged. However, the simple story and brutal violence may not be for everyone.Recommendation:
See it on the big screen for the full impact, but be prepared for a wild ride."
"The selling point for the movie was that this was going to be the most bloodiest goriest Indian film ever. As i started watching I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. Then i realized this film is a lot more violent than what I'm used to seeing in Bollywood films. Bollywood action films have plenty of action and fighting and the hero kills in large numbers, but this dude was doing it with his hands and the blood was pouring from everyone.The commando part was expertly performed by Lakshya. Lakshya performed well in the part because of his well-defined figure, which the director highlighted at key points without giving away a full monty, and his passable acting abilities. Using a subtle blend of wickedness and malicious humour, Raghav played his part perfectly. Since I had never seen him appear on film for such a large amount of time, particularly as a villain, I was pleasantly surprised by his ability to carry off this character."
"Best movie of the year till now.You will get lots of reason to be proud on nsg commando,
super se bhi upar wala action scene,
Blood everywhere,
Currage to kill ,
Raghav juyal's dialogue delivery and action 🤐 ,
Must watch movie in the theatre, ott pr utna mja ni aayega .Superb plot of the movie, not seen this great combo of storie , plot and action in a single movie.If you are someone with childish heart , please refrain from watching this amazing piece of bloody story .IN RAGHAV JUYAL'S WORD THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE NAMED AS - ""KHACH KHACH HOTA HAI"" .YR raghav ne dill kill kar diya ....must watch."
"Amazing movie. If you can't handle violence, please don't watch it but it acted as a stress buster for me as the violence shown is with a purpose and even faint hearted will ask for more. Great acting by everyone. Thanks God there are no songs, unlike other Bollywood movies.Couldn't have imagined that watching this movie will give me a sense of satisfaction and pride for our NSG commandoes.A must watch movie if you want to explore this violent genre. Indian audience is now ready for such an experience. People were cheering and clapping at the most grusome scenes of the movie. Hats off to directors."
"Oustanding Action and thriller
Wow, I am in disbelief that this is a Bollywood film! It is executed in a truly brilliant manner. The setup may be straightforward, but the action, direction, and acting are all outstanding. India's response to the Raid Films. I can't express in enough words how excited I am about what I witnessed. I was rooting for each kill and it remains engaging. The main actor has a promising career ahead in Bollywood and a flawless first film launch. Raghav is a pleasure to see and nails every scene he is in. The entire supporting cast performs admirably, but in the end, this movie belongs to the director. His vision and execution, without diminishing the lead's contributions, are truly remarkable. This movie is an absolute blast for any action enthusiast. No giveaways, just sharing joy like how the film made me happy."
"How often do you watch such movies from Bollywood? It's raw, rough and strangely entertaining. The writing is good, camerawork and action choreography is outstanding. There is nothing unique that this film tries to achieve but still feels fresh. All the characters had a personality to them. Special mention to Raghav Juyal for pulling this out, he's excellent throughout. Never thought that I could hate him but he's so brilliant here that you'll start to despise his character. Seeing Ashish Vidyarthi among so many new faces was a welcome here, all his recent works have been excellent or I don't know if he's a lucky charm in 2024 because whichever ""unique"" film he stars in, it gets hyped. Certainly this film will inspire many forthcoming filmmakers and I certainly want to see more such craft from Bollywood and Indian Cinema as a whole."
"**Review: A Bollywood Action Spectacle on a Moving Train**Bollywood has always been known for its dramatic flair and larger-than-life storytelling, but this film has set a new benchmark by taking action to an unprecedented level. From the moment the first fight sequence unfolds, it's clear that the filmmakers have pushed the boundaries of what is possible in an action movie, all while confined to the unique setting of a moving train. This high-octane film is a testament to the creativity and innovation in the industry, and it stands as a must-watch for anyone with a strong heart, ready to embrace violence and gory scenes.The brilliance of this movie lies in its ability to utilize every inch of the moving train to its advantage. The tight, claustrophobic spaces that one would typically associate with a train are transformed into dynamic arenas for some of the most thrilling fight scenes ever witnessed in Bollywood. The way the characters maneuver through narrow corridors, leap between compartments, and use every element of their surroundings as a weapon is simply mesmerizing. It's reminiscent of the meticulous fight choreography seen in films like ""John Wick,"" where the environment becomes an integral part of the action.One cannot discuss the film without mentioning Lakshay, the film's lead, whose performance is nothing short of phenomenal. His agility and prowess in executing complex fight sequences are commendable. Lakshay's ability to blend intense physical action with genuine acting talent makes him a standout, and it's easy to see him emerging as Bollywood's next big action hero. His movements are fluid and precise, adding a layer of realism and excitement to the already intense action sequences. It's not just about the punches and kicks; it's about how Lakshay immerses himself in the role, making every fight scene a gripping experience.The film's fight choreography deserves special mention. Each action sequence is meticulously planned and executed, creating a symphony of violence that is both brutal and beautiful. The use of the train's surroundings adds an extra layer of complexity to the fights. Characters use seats, luggage racks, and even emergency hammers as weapons, showcasing the creativity of the filmmakers. The choreography is not just about showing violence for the sake of it; it's about crafting scenes that are visually stunning and emotionally impactful.What sets this film apart from other action movies is its ability to maintain a high level of tension and excitement throughout. The train, constantly in motion, serves as a metaphor for the relentless pace of the film. There is no respite for the characters or the audience. The sense of confinement heightens the stakes, making every encounter more intense and every escape more desperate. The filmmakers have masterfully utilized the train's movement to create a sense of urgency and unpredictability.The film also stands out for its cinematography. Capturing high-speed action in the confined spaces of a train is no easy feat, but the cinematographers have done an outstanding job. The camera work is fluid, following the characters through the tight spaces and capturing every punch, kick, and fall with precision. The use of lighting and angles enhances the mood, creating a gritty and immersive experience. The attention to detail in the visual presentation of the action scenes elevates the film to a whole new level.One of the most surprising aspects of the film is its ability to blend high-octane action with a compelling narrative. While the primary focus is on the breathtaking fight sequences, the story never takes a back seat. The characters are well-developed, and their motivations are clear. This balance between action and storytelling is what makes the film more than just a series of fight scenes; it becomes a journey that the audience is invested in.In conclusion, this Bollywood action film is a groundbreaking achievement in the genre. The use of a moving train as the primary setting for its action sequences is innovative and thrilling. Lakshay's performance, combined with exceptional fight choreography and stunning cinematography, makes this a must-watch for action movie enthusiasts. The film sets a new standard for Bollywood action films, and it's exciting to see what the future holds for this genre. If you have the stomach for intense violence and a love for meticulously crafted action, this film is an absolute treat."
"Kill is one of the most raw, brutal, visceral, gory, thrilling, realistic, nail biting, mind blowing, no nonsense action movie ever made in the world. It is truly a milestone for Indian and World Action Cinema that elevates the art form of action cinema to a completely new level. Kill is a brilliant action masterpiece.Combine Bruce Lee, Die Hard, Ip Man, Kill Bill, Ong Bak, Raid, John Wick, add a few gallons of blood, set it on a train, then step up the action and you have got Kill. The movie belongs to the action coordinators, stunt team, set decorators, make up artists, camera work, technical staff who are responsible for this perfect action fest.The casting is perfect. Lakshya is simply brilliant. Raghav Juyal is amazing. Tanya Maniktala is the heart of the movie. Ashish Vidyarthi, Harsh Chhaya, Abhishek Chauhan......I can go on forever. Every single actor in the movie does justice to their characters. The direction is superlative, crisp, fast paced. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for creating something so fresh and hard hitting that it will knock you out.It is not surprising that Kill got standing ovations at multiple Film Festivals, has been compared to the Indonesian Action blockbuster Raid and got bought by the director of John Wick, Chad Stahelski for a Hollywood remake even before its official theatrical release. It deserves much more than what it has already got and definitely has to be experienced on the big screen by all action movie fans.It is very difficult to believe that Karan Johar and Oscar winning documentary producer Guneet Monga are behind such a cracking action movie. It is even more difficult to believe that such a stylish and top class action flick has been made in India.I watched the movie with my dad and both our jaws just dropped multiple times during the movie and my dad's shadow boxing and kicking was on hyper mode through the movie. As we were walking out of the theater, he summarized his experience with these words ""The action was beyond Bollywood, beyond Hollywood, it was just beyond everything"". Kill is a game changer for action movies. A Perfect 10."
"Jist watched this brilliant movie....9/10 rating..all actors did a Brilliant job...havent seen a bollywood movie like this in India in yeears.

"An exceptionally made violent movie. Through out captivating. Every few seconds something new was happening, couldn't take eyes off the screen even for a few seconds or would've missed something. Wasn't at all predictable, the story kept changing and taking a new direction every few minutes or I must say seconds. You'll not feel bored for a moment. No songs, no melodrama, acting of Raghav Juyal was the highlight for me. The action movie makers in India have a lot to learn from this movie. I was stunned on how did they manage to pull out such a thriller. Wasn't at all expected. You'll be in for a surprise and a treat."

"""Kill"" is an amazing action movie that deserves full marks for its cinematography and the direction of its action sequences, which are unprecedented in their intensity within the confines of a train coach. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout, evoking both excitement and emotions. Lakshay emerges as a new star, reminiscent of an Indian Rambo, commanding the screen with charisma and skill. His performance elevates the second half to new heights, overshadowing even the promising start of Raghav. Tanya delivers a memorable portrayal, adding depth and charm to her character. The film's pacing is relentless, with each scene building tension and anticipation, culminating in a gripping finale that leaves a lasting impression. The soundtrack complements the action perfectly, enhancing the emotional impact of each sequence. Overall, ""Kill"" is a must-watch for action enthusiasts, offering a thrilling ride that showcases the best of Indian cinema's talent and innovation in the genre."
"I found the movie really amazing after a long time enjoyed such a movie. The new hero, new villain, everyone's acting is amazing. All acted very well. You can also watch this movie with family.Only those who have faced the situation will understand the pain when an Army man goes all out to get a police officer's daughter who he loves but doesn't get her. I love these kinds of stories. Come with more new ideas, hope to see. The movie will suddenly have a robbery in the train but no one knew that a strange movie looks really good. However, there is nothing new to say, more videos like this should be made so that everyone can have an experience. If you ever become a real person facing such a problem, you can easily find a way to get out of it."
"You think Animal is Violent? Point to disagree.... Hats off to Nikhil Nagesh Bhatt, an absolute beast treat movie, no un necessary cut scenes, no rapid camera movements just pure Bloody Action... Lakshya being the beast, histoic, emotional and killing machine and Raghav being the iconic evil, clever, funny and irk kinda villain.... Insane progression, brave cinematography and specially the adrenaline rush that makes you live the character's emotions. There is a love angle shown between the characters, it doesn't feel unnecessary, its the main point of progression and the aggresive nature of the movie. Easily the best action, gore and violent film ever produced in bollywood (following up with Monkey Man). 8.8/10."
"What a movie... What a movie... What a movieBollywood's first ever no nonsense ultra pro max raw action movie. Just incredible revenge story and lessons to the so called action directors to go, watch and learn what is action movie looks like. No words can describe this. I used to think John Wick is the best action movie and it looks like a kid in front of kill. Newbie actors have done marvellous job. New action star Lakshya is born. Tiger, Manya, Soleman bhai can go home and start restaurant businesses because they are nowhere near this guy. Kills with his eyes, without much to talk and more to act."

"""Kill"" delivers an unprecedented level of raw action never before seen in Indian cinema. The film is near perfect, showcasing realistic and intense fight sequences that feel authentic rather than staged. Lakshya, the young and promising protagonist, shines with his stellar performance, while Raghav Juyal astounds as the cunning and psychotic antagonist. The no-nonsense screenplay, devoid of unnecessary songs or filler scenes, keeps the plot tight and engaging, focusing solely on action and vital emotional moments. Indian cinema needs more action films like this. The other negative characters were also appropriately casted in the movie."
"Going by the recent trends set in Bollywood never expected this kind of movie to be produced and that to by Dharma. This one definitely has a WOW factor with some obvious loopholes and missing links in the plot but movie never deviates from its path. Don't remember any hindi movie with such exhilarating action from start to finish and this one definitely beats Animal in blood shed but like Animal won't be complaining too much about it as it was a unbelievably good watch.Acting wise definitely Raghav Juyal stood out on top followed by Lakshya the who played Captain Amrit - the two main characters of the movie others including Ashish Vidyarthi,Harsh Chhaya and Tanya Maniktala didn't have bigger say but played their part.Overall this is a over the top action movie minus songs and romance which should not be ignored."
"Realism at Its FinestWhat sets ""KILL"" apart from its predecessors is its commitment to realism. Unlike many Indian action movies where the stunts and fight scenes often appear exaggerated and unconvincing, ""KILL"" ensures that every action sequence feels authentic. The film's director, known for his meticulous attention to detail, has worked tirelessly to create scenes that are not only thrilling but also believable. The use of practical effects, combined with top-notch choreography, makes the action sequences stand out. Viewers will find themselves on the edge of their seats, fully immersed in the adrenaline-pumping moments that the film offers.Stellar Performances:
The movie boasts an ensemble cast of some of the finest actors in the industry. The lead actor, whose name has become synonymous with versatility, delivers a powerhouse performance. His dedication to the role is evident in every scene, from the intense fight sequences to the emotionally charged moments. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their characters. The chemistry between the lead actors is palpable, adding an extra layer of tension and excitement to the film."
One of the best action movies in India pure Goosebumps. No drama no slow motion action no unnecessary songs just pure action for whole time in the movie. Having quite emotional moments from hero's side and also from the villains side as well. This film depicts how action could be made in India not like film animal which has only vulgarity. I'm highly recommend this movie to all of you to please watch this movie it is worth to watch for. It'll definitely gives you goosebumps on other hand you'll able to feel the emotion of the hero. You entirely want that he'll kill everyone there. And Raghav has play exceptionally well.
"""From the first explosive scene to the heart-pounding climax, this action movie delivers a non-stop Action ride that kept me on the edge of my seat!

The gore is unapologetically graphic, adding a visceral edge to every battle and making each hit feel real. An absolute masterpiece in the genre - I can't recommend it highly enough!"""
"I watched ""KILL"" today. It's a Die Hard / Rambo type of action movie that is intense, gritty, and violent. The entire story takes place on a train, the Indian Railway There are no songs, almost no romance, and no comedy. The movie is very intense from the first minute to the last frame. It's surprising that there hasn't been much marketing for this movie. It's a must-watch for action movie fans. It has more violence than ""Animal,"" but you won't mind. The screenplay is very different, and the movie's length is 1 hour and 40 minutes. This should have been a bigger hit than ""Salaar"" and ""Saaho"" due to the quality of its content. The movie can feel claustrophobic due to the in-your-face action. . I kept wondering, how can they pull of an active movie on an Indian Train, but they did it so awesomely. Most of the star cast seems to be new, and I couldn't recognize more than 95% of them. But it didn't matter at all because of the genre of the movie. Do watch it, standard disclaimers apply."
"I don't write reviews but This ,this movie is amazing . Not a typical Bollywood masala movie at all . Watch kalki a few days back with its over the top action sequence . This movie is far far better than what they have achieved with their 600 cr budget . All the actors have brilliantly performed but Raghav juyal needs an additional ovation for his performance . He really brings his character to life as a maniacal hysterical little funny villain but equally detestable, you will be waiting for him to just have a gruesome death . All other actors have done justice to their roles as well . Hats off to the director and the action director and the whole crew..."
"The best movie I have seen, the hair on the body stood up while watching the movie, when I saw all the killing parts, the body rose through the cup, after many years I saw an action movie full of violence. Everyone will have fun watching this movie after John week, especially the daku was very scary, and the hero's acting was great, creating hype all the time inside the movie, no one will be bored for a moment, they will like this movie. , for those who like action violence, I heard that Hollywood will remake this movie, if it is true, then it will be a more spicy movie, I am waiting for that 10 a 10 Agun movie."
"Kill' could not make me any more happier as an action movie fan. What goes from a tender romance to a bloody, investing revenge story, Kill is such a gory great time at the movies. The cinematography and set ups for some of the action sequences are done in such a clever way, while the deeper themes are constantly making the gears in your brain go to work. The music keeps your ears moving and switches between different sounds in the best ways possible, while the gore and blood provide some much needed grit to go with this heavy revenge quest. Strong performances by Lakshya and Raghav Juyal make you eager to see how the protagonist and antagonist eventually come to a clash. 'Kill' has everything in its repertoire to not only be the best action film of the year, but one of the best films of the year period!"
This movie is an out and out entertainment and keeps you hooked till the end.New superstar begins his journey.What a work by Raghav hats off and obviously Ashish vidyarthi sir.Best action movie of 2k24.Lionsgate has done the best job producing this movie.Hats off to Nagesh Bhatt the director of Kill.All the characters in the film totally does the justice of their roles and characters portrayed.Happy to see Harsh Chaya sir after longtime.New action star is born.There is no such spoilers in the film because film is out and out action packed and comedy at some point in the film looks apt and not forced.Well done Dharma. Keep making such movies.Looking forward to Pushpa2 and singham again. #pushpa #singhamagain.
"Movie goes on as fast as the train. Best ACTION movie in recent days and good to watch for action lovers. I missed this experience in theatres. Because i was below 18 years and the movie is 'A' rated.The acting of the hero and the emotions he carry throughout the movie is crazy and the screenplay goes like a train so fast. First interval is good but the second half is literally a wow movie. It literaly dont let the audience goes eyes off the screen. Best movie from a new comer the movie still could have run in the theatres but it didn't. Finally, one of the ausumn, blasting movie in the recent days..."
"""Kill"" is an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat! The action sequences are mind-blowing and fabulous, with choreographed fight scenes that are both intense and stylish. I've never seen anything like it before - the kills are creative, brutal, and utterly captivating.The movie's pacing is relentless, with barely a moment to catch your breath between the carnage. The plot is engaging, with unexpected twists and turns that keep you guessing until the very end.Overall, ""Kill"" is a must-watch for fans of action movies. It's a game-changer, with some of the most impressive and memorable kill scenes I've ever seen. Don't miss out on this one - it's a wild ride from start to finish! 5/5 stars!"
"Being a action movie fan, I never had any expectation from Bollywood to deliver a good quality action thriller with world class stunts.. but this movie is an outlier amongst all mediocre Bollywood action movies. In this movie stunts are long cut... The characters bleed, they die. They attack the hero from all directions. & When the protagonist strikes, they don't fly off in air. The stakes are high as f..k. Every moment you will be on the edge of your seat with the anticipation what will happen next moment... Lakshya does a phenomenal job being the protagonist.Whole Bollywood should learn how to make a proper world class action movie, how the stunts should be shot & how to make a phenomenal movie even with some relatively unknown actors.In short if you love action, if you love good story, if you want to be thrilled.. this movie won't disappoint you."
Non-stop action once it kicks off. Relentless fight scenes with barely a second to catch your breath. Definitely not for the faint hearted. I would go so far as to say my head hurt after the movie. I don't know how the time flew as I was riveted to the screen. I recommend not to go if you've had a hard day and want to unwind and relax. Go when you're ready and up for it. By the end I felt like I needed pain killers. I cannot recall the last time I saw an action fight movie with as much action as this. Asian movies are starting to set a new benchmark for relentless action. If you liked Monkey Man then this takes it to another level.
"I don't want to get into this and that. Movies are a source of entertainment and kill does exactly the same. Even you know the ending, predicting it is not the thing for kill. Fast paced and entancing screenplay hooked me up. The movie starts slowly but character build up didn't take long. In approximate 2 hours one can see the emotions of all kind. Also this movie shows up the emotional side of goons/villains how their loss is equally made felt to the audience. Also I think the character of female lead is under written. But I can say this movies deserves a sequel of course main antagonist can be recasted but with new characters keeping the protagonist can also work. This type of action movies deserve recognition.. Indian public has been fed up with slow motion walk hero walking and villains flying here and there. I really wish the makers give a thought about sequel to this movie soon."
"""Kill"" is a groundbreaking entry in Indian cinema, redefining action with its intense fight sequences, storytelling and raw emotion. Set on a train, it combines thrilling fight choreography never before seen in Indian cinema with a straightforward yet engaging plot. There are times that you feel sorry for the bad guys. The performances are stellar, particularly Raghav Juyal, who delivers a memorable portrayal of a villain with depth and character. With its claustrophobic action sequences, ""Kill"" sets a new standard for Bollywood action films, ensuring audiences are both entertained and captivated throughout."
"""Kill 2024"" is a masterpiece of violence and brutality. I absolutely loved it! From start to finish, the film keeps you on the edge of your seat with its intense action sequences and raw, unfiltered storytelling. The visceral impact of the scenes leaves a lasting impression, making it one of the best movies I've ever seen.The cinematography is top-notch, capturing the gritty and harsh reality of the film's world. The direction is flawless, with each scene meticulously crafted to maximize tension and impact. The performances are powerful, bringing a depth to the characters that is often missing in action-heavy films.The storyline is gripping, with enough twists and turns to keep you hooked throughout. The relentless pace and the sheer intensity make ""Kill 2024"" an unforgettable cinematic experience. The film doesn't shy away from showing the darker side of human nature, and it does so with an unflinching honesty that is both shocking and mesmerizing."
"This movie is really worth your time. Amazing movie. Everyone must watch it in theatre. The action is top notch. No melo-drama, no unnecessary songs, and every action is amazing. It's looks like I am watching red redemption. Everyone must watch and support this film. Maybe we can have a sequel. I highly recommended to watch it in theatre. People in india should watch this masterpiece. I am sure you will clap It's action sequences. This movie is served to be an action film and it's an absolutely Justify it's narrative. We need more film like this. The blood bath, the actions are goosebumps. I just wished it had some one cut action sequences like 'john wick' film."
"An amazing piece for all the Action lovers out there. Story begins like any other love story and takes a sudden unpredictable turn. And it keeps spinning thereafter. Here's why you should watch it-1. Great performances by both protagonist, Lakshya & the antagonist, Raghav Juyal.2. The visual effects make it a near-real experience.3. It's different from any other action movie ever made in India.4. Fresh action sequences never stop coming.5. Takes one through an emotional rollercoaster while the character of the protagonist grows.In summary, it is a power packed Action-drama that manages to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Roles of female lead & supporting action hero could have been better. Nevertheless, it justifies it's name KILL!"
If u want a action packed movie after long time in bollywood.. this movie did the justice of being a superhit in action. At any point it doesn't seem boring or lengthy. Superb star cast.. superb acting. 9star out of 10. One star deducted due to the train in the story taking too much time to reach the next station. Each and every actor has done a very good job. I don't know why in the news they are saying that it is not a hit. But for me it is a super duper hit.. you can watch it twice in the same day . The storyline is also very good. This movie shows how a commondo is different from a normal person. Jai hind.

"The adrenaline and rage felt after watching it was unreal! My hope was to see an Indian action movie on par with other South Asian films one day (like Ong Bak, The Raid, The Raid 2 and many more). It was answered with this.Realistic action choreography, style and slickness, creativity, logical reasoning, emotions, EVERYTHING is world-class cinema!It's a masterpiece among action films, one to feel proud of and see the capability that Indian cinema can be like this too and more!Nikhil Bhat directing, Karan Johar and Guneet Monga producing, Lakshay and Raghav acting, Rafey Mehmood cinematography, stunt coordinators, production designers, everyone incredible!DISCLAIMER: BLOOD & VIOLENCE 💯💯"
"Kill is an exhilarating action thriller that grips you from start to finish. Set against the backdrop of a high-speed train journey to New Delhi, the film follows a pair of commandos as they confront a ruthless army of invading bandits. The plot is intense, with well-choreographed action sequences that keep the adrenaline pumping. The characters are compelling, particularly the commandos, who display remarkable bravery and tactical prowess. The cinematography captures the claustrophobic tension of the train, adding to the overall suspense. ""Kill"" is a must-watch for action enthusiasts, delivering non-stop excitement and a gripping storyline."
"A very good, exceptional movie made with a very small budget. Editing, cinematography, choreagraphy, action choreagraphy, stunts ae all very well done and the hard work is very much visible. Performance by all crew members is very commendable. Everything happens in train, storyis action packed or action is story packed. Good pacing. There are no boring dance or song sequences. There are no dull moments. There is nothing to forward to, you might want to rewind many scenes to grasph what happened. BGM is not monotonous but there is a variety of background music, uniquely fitting the scenes and the emotions."
"Honestly i barely watch bollywood movies in theatres but I am glad that I watched this masterpiece. Loved each and every action piece that was so excellently put together. Raghav Juyal made the movie more lively. Being the first movie for Lakshya, it never felt that this movie was coming from a debutant. I cannot imagine anyone in the main role but Lakshya. Tanya Maniktala was the soul of the movie. Her expressions speaks so much more than the dialogues and I enjoyed watching her onscreen too. Overall I think this is the best action movie bollywood has ever made so far. MUST WATCH IN THEATRE!!!!!"
"""KILL"" is an exceptionally crafted film that seamlessly blends intense action, deep emotion, and a palpable sense of menace.

"A CULT CLASSIC & BAAP of action movies! A Must Watch movie esp for action lovers.Not for the faint hearted (FULL OF GORE AND BLOOD). Fast paced without irrelevant scenes or songs, it's about time Indian film industry should be producing one.Hand to hand combat fights was SUPERB and serves right than shooting guns only, every fight scene is authentic (unlike Baaghi where all the fight scenes were copied from The Raid), A first of it's kind in Indian cinema. BGM in fight scenes was also outstanding! Kudos to the team, feels like I paid less than the movie deserves. You won't regret watching KILL, go for it now!!"
"Perfect eeAction Thriller
It was just unbelievable that the cast did a great performance
crew efforts show clearly and trill never ends till the climax
best action movie
#SuperDirection #GreatActing #Rocking #WellmadeSandeep Reddy Wanga should learn from KILL how violent movies has been made. Adding intimate scenes & try to trigger critics does not make a director successful. Rather Wanga is a biggest clown. KILL movie is a finest example how violence & gore can be create without using adding any bed scenes.The proper blend of dark light., dark narration., bgm & gore is a treat for the mature audience to see blood feast on screen.. Story is very simple but what makes it different was its screenplay. Movie never shows any interest in love angle., songs.. bogus one liners or 'f' words. Only take few times to set the story & the trill begins.If this movie fails plzz guys don't put blame on Bollywood for not trying something hatke. Actually we will if this movie fail.."
"The detailing of every scene in this movie is fantastic. It is an action packed movie and they way the presentation of done on the screen, you will enjoy every moment. Not a second of monotonous moment is present. Just amazing to see these type of movies coming in Bollywood. The actors have done a fantastic job. Raghav Juyel is perfect. The dialogue delivery, the action, the emotions, all are top notch. I don't remember the name of the main actor.. But the acting and action done by him is outstanding. The story building and the presentation sequence is my favourite part. Particularly the second half of the movie is highly exciting."

"When two commandos aboard a train to reconnect with a loved one, never in their lifetime did they ever imagine they would have to put their skills to the test to protect themselves and others from thieves and killers, this film starts out rather mild, romantic and quite likeable, especially the lead actor and his female co-star. Once the film progresses, the tempo slowly turns tense, once we witness the bad guys, so we soon learn very quickly their intentions, this movie takes the viewer into various episodes of extreme bloodshed and breathtaking violence, as the film moves forward, we get to watch the hero virtually loses his mind and goes on quest to wipe-out everybody who caused him grief and anguish, the director did a good job with the fight choreography and projecting the madness of the commando and the doubt and fear of the villains, I will not further divulge any more information, if this film is available to watch and you are immune to graphic violence then this is your jam, the last film I watch like this was the night come for us and that was very similar to this one minus the martial arts, best action film of the year in my opinion, Monkey man in second place."
"I loved it .... awesome direction, actions scene .. #mustwatchmovies.. strongly recommend to watch this movie. The film's soundtrack, composed by K. Ng, amplifies the tension and excitement, blending orchestral motifs with modern beats to underscore key moments of action and drama. Sound design plays a crucial role in immersing viewers in the gritty urban environment, from the roar of engines to the deafening roar of gunfire. The film's soundtrack, composed by K.

"Watched this movie and I must say WOW , full of intense action thriller sequences. Breath taking action and the storyline was great. The whole cast was great and the characters were so good. After a long time I really enjoyed the movie. I wish the movie was more long lasting. I'd love to watch it again. They should make movies like this . Still thinking about the movie. The ending was awesome . They should make the sequel to this movie and cast the same Hero . Best movie of the year 2024 so far .I have to say it's something different.The direction was very good for the first time. WELL DONE !"
"Kill (2023)' is already violent before a certain something happens and its lead character totally snaps. After that happens, it becomes a veritable bloodbath as the protagonist abandons the notion of taking prisoners (and being a hero) and becomes preoccupied with only a single, instructive thought (look no further than the title if you need a clue as to what that is). From the 45-minute mark, this is a bone-crunching, blood-spilling, neck-snapping, face-smashing, fire-setting, head-crushing experience in sheer, unadulterated savagery. What stands out the most about all the well-choreographed, pulse-pounding brutality is the fact that it has tangible consequences. It's not just exciting, throwaway movie violence meant to provide slick entertainment as a kind of barbaric ballet, it's visceral, gut-wrenching, squirm-in-your-seat sort of stuff that constantly makes you question what kind of man (or monster) the protagonist is now that all pretences of being an honorable hero have gone out the window. His unrelenting, indiscriminate, vengeance-fuelled viciousness causes just as much grief as the ruthless actions of his enemies, and the only thing that keeps him in the position of 'good guy' (even if his actions make him definitely not a good guy) is the fact that his foes started this whole bloody affair. You almost feel sorry for the baddies, who are caught totally unaware by the murderous rage they unwittingly unleash and mostly don't seem as though they signed up to experience the consequences of their leader's rash actions. They're not an elite team of criminals capable of facing whatever threat is thrown at them. They also aren't just a bunch of faceless goons who don't care about each other and are totally expendable to their employer; they're an extended family with names, implied personalities and defined relationships to one another. They get angry, they get scared and, most potently, they grieve their loved ones. That's perhaps the most potent aspect - and prevailing emotion - of the entire affair: grief. It's a really tragic picture that makes sure to show not only the innocent victims mourning the loss of their family members, but also the bandits themselves. Everyone who dies here is grieved by someone else, and it really makes you stop and think about the reality of all the carnage you witness. For most passengers on the train, it would have been less traumatic simply to get robbed by these thieves than it is to see them almost literally get torn to pieces right before their eyes. It's a really distinct experience in that regard, balancing the fun of its frenetic, often jaw-dropping action with the horror of its life-ending devastation. This means that although a lot of the kills are downright sadistic, the flick never feels as though it's outright endorsing the violence at its core, making it as off-putting as possible both in terms of pain and morality. Very few people make it out of this thing alive and that's exactly its point: violence begets violence. It truly is unique when it comes to how deeply it indulges in fast-paced ferocity (death is at its very core, after all) while simultaneously implicitly decrying it. It's one of the most violent action movies, and it strikes a balance between being entertaining and horrifying. It's hard to get fully wrapped up in the glee of its confident genre goodness (of which there's plenty) when you're constantly reminded how gruesome it all is/ would be in reality. That's not to imply it's anything less than a pulse-pounding, propulsive action extravaganza with a tight pace and an expert control over its on-screen chaos. As my brother put it, it istantly feels like a stone-cold action classic. 'John Wick (2015)', 'The Raid (2011)', 'Kill (2024)'. It isn't out of place among those movies, which just so happen to be some of the best actioners of all time. While I can't confidently put it in that 'best of the best' category just yet (I've only seen it once, after all), I can say that it's a balls-to-the-wall, blisteringly feral experience that wears its genre like a badge of honor but also isn't quite like anything else within it. It's well-made in every area and is thunderously entertaining. Its interesting implicit exploration of the morality of its violence is something you have to see to fully appreciate, and its portrayal of grief on both sides of the good guy/ bad guy spectrum is genuinely quite potent. It made me somewhat emotional in unexpected ways. It's a really vital and bracing effort that's easily a highlight of the entire year. It's great."
"One of the best action set piece I have seen this movie was very unexpected this just came out of the box!!!!!!! What a performance from the cast what a screenplay what a story movie is brilliant in every aspect!!!!! Can't nitpick..... No one should miss this movie in theatre...... The hooting and applauses and the whistling in every kill shows what a cinematic pleasure it is but also it's not for the light hearted soo be aware of that
I this this amount of hooting applauses was not even seen in srk movies
The way the character builds up is just fabulous
This is bollywood speaking to the world....."
"In my opinion, any fight master or action choreographer would prefer to work in open spaces, where they can execute their action sequences with precision and ease, in a safe and hassle-free environment, avoiding potential accidents or injuries. However, when the script requires close proximity, it becomes a daunting task for the action choreographer, and equally challenging for the cinematographer and director, who must work in tandem to capture the action sequences effectively in a confined space.""Kill"" directed by which is unknown face in Bollywood ""Nikhil Nagesh Bhat"" but what kind of cine product he has directed should stun his contemporaries. Film is fantastically cut, Editorial department ""Kill"" must be praised. Pacing of film is so excellent its start and end in just 165 minutes never let us feel that we have missed anything.""The true essence of 'Kill' lies in its meticulously crafted action scenes, which required an expert action director capable of designing prolonged sequences in confined spaces, such as a moving train. Se-Yeong Oh was a natural choice to design the lengthy and gory action sequences in 'Kill', given his experience in providing similar services for the Hollywood film 'Snowpiercer', starring Chris Evans. The work Se-Yeong Oh has done for 'Kill' makes it the most lethal and goriest Bollywood film to date. Alongside Se-Yeong Oh, the other action director, Pervaiz Sheikh, known for his work on films like 'Fighter', has also played a crucial role in making 'Kill' a non-stop and bloodiest rollercoaster ride. Both action directors are the true heroes of the film, making 'Kill' a thrilling and unforgettable experience.""'Kill' is a sleek and streamlined cinematic production that eschews traditional Bollywood staples like drama, romantic scenes, and music, relegating these typically essential elements to the periphery. Instead, the film's action sequences take center stage, seamlessly blending with the background music to create a cohesive and thrilling experience that leaves no room for unnecessary embellishments.""The cinematography by Rafey Mehmood is exceptional, masterfully capturing the entire film within the confined space of a moving train. The visuals are seamless and cohesive, with no scene feeling out of place or context. Rafey Mehmood's work is a testament to his skill and experience, reaffirming that he is the same talented individual who lensed the Oscar-nominated film 'Lagaan'.""The film 'Kill' marks the debut of Lakshye as ""Amrit Rathor"", a newcomer to the Bollywood scene. Although 'Kill' may not fully showcase his acting abilities, his performance in the film's intense hand-to-hand combat sequences is impressive and far from amateurish. Judging by his action scenes in 'Kill', Lakshye seems poised to give established Bollywood stars a run for their money, hinting at a promising career ahead.""Raghav Juyal has stunned audiences with his villainous transformation, shedding his signature slow-motion dance moves to excel as the ruthless Fani. Meanwhile, seasoned actor Ashish Vidyarthi initially portrays the calm and collected mastermind Beni, but as the film's pace intensifies, his vengeance grows, making one root for his demise at the hands of Amrit Rathor. The latter's ultimate triumph over Beni is the most gruesome of all. Abishek Chauhan, famed for his role in Asur, also delivers a remarkable performance, surprising us with his impressive action skills as Viresh Chatwal.""All in all, 'Kill' stands out as the top action film of the year so far, and it's no wonder that the makers of the 'John Wick' franchise have acquired the rights to remake it. The film's exceptional action sequences and engaging storyline have made it a standout in the genre, making it a prime candidate for a Hollywood remake."
"It's an excellent action-packed movie, both the direction and screenplay are brilliant. Although some of its scenes are a bit disgusting, this film could be the game changer in Hindi cinema.This film is not copied from any Hollywood film, but some things can be compared to Hollywood films. And most importantly, its story line, which is completely different and has a little love angle, but this is the basic story background.All the actors are superb especially Raghav who is not much dominating but his expression is just wow.If you like John Wick Franchise then you must watch this film.I'm looking forward for the second part of the movie."
"The first 45 minutes of Kill presents itself as standard Bollywood action fare, with no real surprises in the screenplay. It's only when the title card shows up that the film shifts into high gear. Almost everything about it suddenly undergoes a transition - the lighting, the music, the ferocity in performances, and the bloodshed. The action thereafter, is brutal and unflinching - Lakshya truly showcases his ""special set of skills"" here. While he's somewhat basic as a cliched romantic hero (which thankfully is restricted to a few minutes), he dazzles when it comes to taking punches and stabs, as well as giving it back to the baddies in exponentially vicious ways. Also, while the plot might be fairly basic, there's added texture given to even the minor characters (read: a large family of thieving thugs) making the stakes higher and more interesting as the second act commences.Raghav Juyal and Ashish Vidyarthi are the only other known faces - they're both solid, especially the former. There are scenes you'd remember just for Juyal's menacing screen presence. Tanya Maniktala also gets scenes beyond being a regular damsel-in-distress heroine, managing to leave a lasting impression. Oh Se-Yeong, the South Korean action director pulls off the unthinkable - executing believable stunts within the confines of a moving train, and making audiences feel the intensity of every slit, punch, kick, stab, hit, gunshot - whatever move one can think of. Kill offers a satisfying mix of gore and action, without spending time on typical Bollywood film checklists - that itself feels SO REFRESHING!P. S. While the CG shots lack finesse, they're far too few to be bickering about."
